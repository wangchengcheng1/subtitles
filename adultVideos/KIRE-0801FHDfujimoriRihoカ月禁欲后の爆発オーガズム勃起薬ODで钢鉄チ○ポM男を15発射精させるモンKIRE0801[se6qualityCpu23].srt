1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,540
In the night, you wake me up when the sun goes down


00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,720
Feelings right, you wake me up when the sun goes down

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,680
Sleepless nights, you wake me up when the sun goes down

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,940
I can't help it, baby, not myself when the sun goes down

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:28,940
When the sun goes down

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Wake me up when the sun goes down

7
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,380
It hurts, doesn't it?

8
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,020
Are you feeling better?

9
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,800
I can't help it.

10
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,420
You know how I feel, don't you?

11
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,460
Of course, I know.

12
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,480
I can't do this anymore.

13
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,020
Are you crying?

14
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,330
No, I haven't taken a shower yet.

15
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,310
I'm sweating.

16
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,370
Oh no, I really got a cramp on my back.

17
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,700
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm sorry, but please listen to me.

19
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,700
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,760
Oh, I got it, I got it.

22
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:18,760


23
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,440
Oh, I'm so tired.

24
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,080
Oh, I'm so tired.

25
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,400


26
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:59,870
I

27
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,190
I feel like I'm going to puke.

28
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,990
I feel like I'm going to puke.

29
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,280
It's amazing.

30
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,160
I haven't seen an orange in a long time.

31
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,720
I want to look at it from here.

32
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,320
It's so dirty.

33
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,980
It's going to look like this.

34
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
It's going to go away with my eyes.

35
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,220
It's so dirty.

36
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,390
Look at me.

37
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,810
Look at me.

38
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:35,990
Why are you moving here?

39
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,580
I'm sorry, I can't move.

40
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,840
If you're moving like that, put it in from the back.

41
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,160
The rubber is bitter.

42
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Wait, wait.

43
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,350
I haven't put this in yet.

44
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Is it this way?

45
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,070
I was waiting for you.

46
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm sorry.

47
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,880
It was a very attractive teaching, so I licked it a lot.

48
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,220
I can't stand it anymore.

49
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,860
I understand.

50
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,220
I got it.

51
00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:00,560
It feels good.

52
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,210
What is this? Do you like it?

53
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm sorry.

54
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,010
I'm going to be a watchman from now on.

55
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:47,340
I don't know how to do it.

56
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,680
I don't know how to do it.

57
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm going in.

58
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm going in.

59
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,220
I'm sorry.

60
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm sorry.

61
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,460
I'm sorry.

62
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm sorry.

63
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm sorry.

64
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,580
I'm sorry.

65
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,900
I'm sorry.

66
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,540
I'm sorry.

67
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Oh, my God.

68
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,640
Are you okay?

69
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,560
Are you okay?

70
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,460
Here, here, here!

71
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:51,730
Choco

72
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,090
If only I could do it.

73
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,260
You haven't cut it all out, have you?

74
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,180
I still want to do it.

75
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,900
Is it okay, Fujima-san?

76
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,480
Are you sure you don't want to do it?

77
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,180
Yeah.

78
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,400
Ah!

79
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,850
Oh!

80
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:53,280
Mom, you know,

81
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,640
your hair is stuck in this part.

82
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,560
I don't know.

83
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,740
Men don't really know that.

84
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,340
It's fine.

85
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,350
It's still stuck, right?

86
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,890
I'm still...

87
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,010
I still don't have enough hair.

88
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:33,310


89
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,830
It's a mistake.

90
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
It feels good.

91
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,520
Yes, it feels good.

92
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,480
The other side too.

93
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

94
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:43,250


95
00:23:28,890 --> 00:24:25,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

96
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,560
I can't breathe.

97
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,720
It feels so good.

98
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,680
It feels so good.

99
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,280
I can't breathe.

100
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,360
I can't breathe.

101
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,780
I can't breathe.

102
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,580
I can't breathe.

103
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,980
I can't breathe.

104
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,580
I can't breathe.

105
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,900
I can't breathe.

106
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,880
I can't breathe.

107
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,200
I'll send it to you.

108
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,840
Are you okay?

109
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:41,500
It's hot.

110
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:45,810
Wait a minute.

111
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,480
It's hot.

112
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,300
My shoes are dirty.

113
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,560
What are you doing?

114
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,920
I haven't done anything.

115
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,060
I can't stand it.

116
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,780
I'll do it, too.

117
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,830
I've never done this before.

118
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,620
Please don't get wet.

119
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,340
What's going to happen if I drink it up?

120
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm going to get out of here.

121
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,920
Why are you going to get out of here?

122
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,560
Wait a minute.

123
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Wait a minute.

124
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,980
I'm going to cry.

125
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,140
I'm going to cry.

126
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Are you okay?

127
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,080
Are you okay? I'm not going to die.

128
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Are you okay?

129
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,860
I'm sorry.

130
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,060
I'm sorry, I've said too much.

131
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,780
No way, didn't I tell you not to cry?

132
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,920
Didn't I tell you not to cry?

133
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,980
What did I tell you?

134
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,000
I told you not to cry.

135
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,340
You made my throat hurt.

136
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,500
Sorry, what should I do?

137
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,940
I don't think I can sleep with my mouth open.

138
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,660
Let's do it one more time.

139
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,600
Let's do it one more time.

140
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,740
Let's do it one more time.

141
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,020
Let's do it one more time.

142
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,140
I got it. I got it.

143
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,940
It's so good. There's more here.

144
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,940
Yes. Yes.

145
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:51,480


146
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,630
I want to lick it, but...

147
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,230
Then lick it and make it harder.

148
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,250
Okay.

149
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,610
It feels good.

150
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,270
This is bad.

151
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:26,610
Give it back.

152
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,510
How's your butt?

153
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,430
Yes.

154
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,170
Do you like your butt?

155
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,330
Yes.

156
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,050
Yes?

157
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,730
Yes, it's good.

158
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,570
Just put your chin in.

159
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,750
Do you want me to give you a massage?

160
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,510
It feels so good!

161
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,570
I feel like I'm going to get a cramp.

162
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,350
I'm so crampy.

163
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,290
That's not true.

164
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,090
Isn't this crazy?

165
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:30,860


166
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:33,380


167
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:43,160
I can feel it in my eyes and ears.

168
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:55,670
Oh

169
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:05,550


170
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,260
I can do it.

171
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,250
Please don't close the door.

172
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,470
It's coming out.

173
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,750
It's coming out.

174
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,890
It's just a guitar.

175
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,870
It's coming out.

176
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,590
It's coming out.

177
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,410
It's coming out.

178
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,950
It's coming out. You can't move it.

179
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,230
No, it's not like that.

180
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:07,770
Ah!

181
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,070
Ah!

182
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:15,910
Ah!

183
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,300
Ah!

184
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Ah!

185
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,240
Ah!

186
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Ah!

187
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,480
I didn't have enough from the back earlier, so please put more on.

188
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,600
Okay, I'll put more on.

189
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,520
Here you go.

190
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Thank you.

191
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,810
Thank you so much.

192
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,510
You're welcome.

193
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,770


194
00:42:36,380 --> 00:43:06,190


195
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:50,820


196
00:43:50,820 --> 00:45:03,450


197
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,560
You want to do more, don't you?

198
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,740
No, I just don't feel like it.

199
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,600
Then I have something for you.

200
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,740
What?

201
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,290
Do you want to know?

202
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,710
I want to know.

203
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:38,550
What is this?

204
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,020
What is this?

205
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,140
I don't know.

206
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,880
I want to do a lot, so I brought it.

207
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,880
Open it.

208
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,120
Give it to me.

209
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,700
What?

210
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,540
Ah.

211
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,030
Ah.

212
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,270
Ah.

213
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:12,390
I have a good feeling about this.

214
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:21,490
Okay.

215
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,860
You're going to come back to life soon.

216
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,160
No, no, no.

217
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,480
That's not...

218
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,040
Ah.

219
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,320
Then, do you want to try it?

220
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,120
Ah.

221
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,540
Ah.

222
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,920
Ah.

223
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,960
Ah.

224
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,000
Ah.

225
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,360
Ah.

226
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,120
Ah.

227
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:45,700
Ah.

228
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,260
This is amazing.

229
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,620
Look at this.

230
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,420
It's getting hotter and hotter, isn't it?

231
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,040
Yes.

232
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,840
This is amazing.

233
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,140
Okay.

234
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:58,780
Ouch.

235
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,280
More?

236
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,450
Dad, this dance is amazing.

237
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,750
Does it feel good?

238
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:17,630
Yes, it feels good.

239
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,890
It feels good because it hurts, right?

240
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,510
Yes, it feels good.

241
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:28,510


242
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,270
Can you do it one more time?

243
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,890
Can you do it one more time?

244
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:05,910
I'm going to puke.

245
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:07,870
I'm sorry.

246
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,780
Ouch!

247
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,160
It hurts so much.

248
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,060
I'm not done yet.

249
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,200
I'm not done licking it.

250
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,860
Hey, didn't you go faster than Manco?

251
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,820
That's not true.

252
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,720
No, that's not true.

253
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,540
That's not true.

254
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,120
That's not true.

255
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,580
It's not going to be hard, right?

256
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,580
It's not going to be hard.

257
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,640
I won't give it back to you today.

258
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,300
Oh, okay.

259
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,980
Open your mouth.

260
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,480
You still have it, don't you?

261
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Oh, I see.

262
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,490
Chomo-san, what was that just now?

263
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,420
I didn't even touch it, but it was tickling me all day.

264
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,340
I feel better after drinking the alcohol.

265
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,880
It feels good.

266
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,180
Go this way.

267
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,360
It's completely different.

268
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:13,400
This is really...

269
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,510
It's more painful than before.

270
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:31,090
I feel like my stomach is going to explode.

271
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Look at me.

272
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,510
I love you.

273
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:35,330
Yeah.

274
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:03,210
This is the first time I've been sandwiched like this.

275
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,360
It feels good.

276
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,260
Yeah, it feels good.

277
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,430
I get even more excited when I see your face.

278
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,290
Really?

279
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,380
Do you like it?

280
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,320
No, it's my first time.

281
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,870
It feels so good.

282
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,620
It feels good.

283
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,580
I feel like I'm going to go into my nipples.

284
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,700
What?

285
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,320
My nipples don't feel good at all.

286
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,660
Really?

287
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,740
You've been in there all this time.

288
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,120
I can't do this anymore.

289
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,400
Are you reacting?

290
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,880
Yes, I am.

291
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,840
You are moving.

292
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,060
Yes.

293
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,900
It feels good.

294
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,020
Tighten your tongue.

295
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,720
Yes.

296
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,640
Tickle it.

297
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,200
It feels good.

298
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,980
Oh, my God.

299
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,240
I can't do this anymore.

300
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,460
I can't do this anymore.

301
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,420
Oh my god.

302
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,900
Oh my god.

303
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,540
Oh my god.

304
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,540
Oh my god.

305
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,600
Oh my god.

306
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,760
Oh my god.

307
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,260
Oh my god.

308
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,000
I can't do this anymore.

309
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,060
I can't do this anymore.

310
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,280
I don't want to do it.

311
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,640
I'm sorry.

312
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,540
I'm sorry.

313
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,500
I'm sorry.

314
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,640
I'm sorry.

315
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,600
I'm sorry.

316
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,040
I'm sorry.

317
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,020
I'm sorry.

318
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,620
I'm sorry.

319
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,340
I'm sorry.

320
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,340
I'm sorry.

321
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,420
I'm sorry.

322
00:58:52,790 --> 00:59:00,790
I can't do this anymore.

323
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,320
Why are you doing this to me?

324
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,100
Because I feel so good.

325
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:20,380
I can't do this anymore.

326
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,900
I can't do this anymore.

327
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,320
I can't do this anymore.

328
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,100
I can't do this anymore.

329
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,120
I can't do this anymore.

330
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,080
I can't do this anymore.

331
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,900
I can't do this anymore.

332
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:47,900
I can't do this anymore.

333
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,620
I can't do this anymore.

334
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:51,640
I can't do this anymore.

335
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:51,680
I can't do this anymore.

336
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:51,700
I can't do this anymore.

337
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:51,800
I can't do this anymore.

338
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,740
Of course it is!

339
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,390
My sweet potato!

340
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,250
It feels so good!

341
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:31,870
It does!

342
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,560
Can you hold it for me?

343
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,300
Of course I can!

344
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,620
Please let me hold it for you.

345
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,040
It hurts!

346
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:15,980
I don't want to do this anymore.

347
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:11,900
I don't want to do this anymore.

348
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:27,520
I don't want to do this anymore.

349
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:35,520
I don't want to do this anymore.

350
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:18,600
I can't do this anymore.

351
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:39,350
I can't do this anymore, what am I going to do?

352
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:23,330
I love you, Shino.

353
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,610
You're amazing.

354
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:44,470
I'm so happy.

355
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,960
My hands hurt.

356
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:28,080
I'm scared.

357
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:35,820
I can't do this.

358
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,600
I can't do this.

359
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,160
I can't do this.

360
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:47,320
I can't do this.

361
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:55,640
I can't do this.

362
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:07,830
I can't take it anymore.

363
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,770
I can't take it anymore.

364
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:15,050
I can't take it anymore.

365
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,230
I can't take it anymore.

366
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,330
I can't take it anymore.

367
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:27,890
I can't take it anymore.

368
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,830
I can't take it anymore.

369
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,670
I can't take it anymore.

370
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,300
I can't take it anymore.

371
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,640
I can't take it anymore.

372
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,120
I can't take it anymore.

373
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,980
I can't take it anymore.

374
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:47,080
Mmm.

375
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,160
Mmm.

376
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:02,570
Mmm.

377
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:04,110
Mmm.

378
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,010
Mmm.

379
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,650
Mmm.

380
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:09,130
Mmm.

381
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:09,910
Mmm.

382
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:10,130
Mmm.

383
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,290
Mmm.

384
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:12,670
Mmm.

385
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,110
Mmm.

386
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,490
Mmm.

387
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:17,690
Mmm.

388
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:21,310
Mmm.

389
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:21,330
Mmm.

390
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:23,170
Mmm.

391
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:23,830
Mmm.

392
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:25,230
Mmm.

393
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:26,050
Mmm.

394
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:26,290
Mmm.

395
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,330
Oh, my God.

396
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,170
Oh, my God.

397
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:34,090
Oh, my God.

398
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:35,510
Oh, my God.

399
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:39,850
Oh, my God.

400
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:43,070
Oh, my God.

401
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,670
Oh, my God.

402
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,370
Oh, my God.

403
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:52,570
Oh, my God.

404
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,070
Oh, my God.

405
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,130
Oh, my God.

406
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:56,270
Oh, my God.

407
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:04,270


408
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,920
I can't do this.

409
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:54,400


410
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,900
I can't do this anymore.

411
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:15,780
Wait a minute.

412
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,120
My nipples too.

413
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,140
I can't move anymore.

414
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:26,600
It hurts.

415
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:52,470
Ah, it feels good, doesn't it?

416
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,770
Thank you very much.

417
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,090
Please let me release everything that was in my body.

418
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,210
Please.

419
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:33,830
Oh

420
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,220
It's okay, it's okay.

421
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:46,120
Oh

422
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:16,120


423
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:26,780
It's so good!

424
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:38,150
Please, eat more.

425
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,490
Okay.

426
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:38,650


427
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:55,390


428
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,510
I can't take it anymore.

429
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:22,620
I can't take it anymore.

430
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,420
I can't take it anymore.

431
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,540
I can't take it anymore.

432
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:31,980
I can't take it anymore.

433
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,360
I can't take it anymore.

434
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:33,480
I can't take it anymore.

435
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,300
I can't take it anymore.

436
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:35,660
I can't take it anymore.

437
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:36,680
I can't take it anymore.

438
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:36,920
I can't take it anymore.

439
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,700
This is amazing, isn't it?

440
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,560
Yes.

441
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:48,640
My mouth is burning.

442
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:27,940


443
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:54,350
Oh

444
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:56,040


445
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:49,120
Oh

446
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Oh

447
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,740
Oh

448
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:10,660


449
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,860
It's good, isn't it?

450
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,180
It's good, isn't it?

451
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,020
It's good, isn't it?

452
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,840
It's good, isn't it?

453
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:48,020
It's good, isn't it?

454
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,500
It's good, isn't it?

455
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,160
It's good, isn't it?

456
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,520
It's good, isn't it?

457
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,480
It's good, isn't it?

458
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,000
It's good, isn't it?

459
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:32,210
I don't know what to do, but I can't move.

460
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:25,120
You can't move?

461
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:25,200
You don't want to eat it?

462
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,780
You know what to do, don't you?

463
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:46,000
I'm going to eat it all by myself.

464
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:48,940
Do you like it?

465
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,400
Please give it to me.

466
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,980
I can't open my mouth.

467
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:44,550
I'm sorry.

468
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,970
I'm sorry.

469
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:48,910
I'm sorry.

470
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:49,310
Do you want me to stop?

471
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:55,630
I can't even stretch my legs.

472
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:56,430
Really?

473
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:58,030
It feels so good.

474
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:01,590
I'm so excited to die.

475
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:11,730
It feels so good.

476
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:23,850
I'm going to go crazy.

477
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:25,950
I'm going to go crazy.

478
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:28,890
I'm going to go crazy.

479
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:32,030
I'm going to go crazy.

480
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:48,700
I can't do this anymore.

481
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:12,050
My head hurts!

482
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:08,160
Can I touch your head?

483
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:31,990
Are you okay?

484
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:33,710
I'm fine. Hurry up!

485
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,370
Okay, I got it.

486
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:37,270
It's so hot!

487
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:50,870


488
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:33,320
Oh

489
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:43,020
I can't feel anything.

490
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,260
I can't breathe.

491
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:55,970
I can't feel anything.

492
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,620
It's good even if you eat slowly.

493
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,020
My face is melting.

494
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:48,180
Don't worry.

495
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:51,520
Your face will be fine.

496
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:15,620
Oh

497
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:17,600


498
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:51,780
Oh, my God.
