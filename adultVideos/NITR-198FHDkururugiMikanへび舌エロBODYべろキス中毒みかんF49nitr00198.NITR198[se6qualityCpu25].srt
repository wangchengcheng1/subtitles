1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,300
Oh


00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,920
What's wrong?

3
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,110
What's wrong?

4
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,090
I don't know.

5
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,250
I can see it.

6
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,750
I can't talk at all.

7
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,570
You can't talk at all?

8
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,090
What?

9
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,530
Do you want me to talk?

10
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,810
That's right.

11
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,990
You want me to talk?

12
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,550
That's right.

13
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,230
Then let's talk.

14
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,850


15
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,810
Is that so?

16
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:04,270


17
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,430
I want to take a picture of that today.

18
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,010
Do you feel like you don't have to be so formal today?

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,570
Yes.

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,050
You don't have to be so formal.

21
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,810
You may have done it many times, but can you introduce yourself again?

22
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,350
Yes, I'll introduce myself.

23
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,450
Yes, by yourself.

24
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,290
I'm Kururugi Mikan.

25
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,410
Can you show me how it looks?

26
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,510
I'll show you.

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,430
What should I do?

28
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,000
The three sizes are...

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,420
96,

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,120
96,

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,380
58,

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,460
no, 92, 58,

33
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,300
86.

34
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,140
You're really good at this.

35
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,400
What's your chest size?

36
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,560
92cm

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,100
What's your cup size?

38
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,320
G cup

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,400
Can you introduce yourself?

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,360
My charm point is my mouth.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
What's wrong with your mouth?

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,040
I have a long tongue.

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
The last one is Charm Point.

44
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,580
I see.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Do you want to use Charm Point?

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,400
No.

47
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,960
Charm Point.

48
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not Charm, it's a weapon.

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,640
It's a weapon.

50
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,560
It's a weapon of MikaPon.

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,940
It's a weapon of MikaPon.

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,580
By the way, I really want to see it.

53
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,720
Really?

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,500
Yes.

55
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,260
Yes, that's right.

56
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,560
Do you want me to show it to you?

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,140
Yes, please.

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,580
What should I do?

59
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,420
I'm going to tease you a little bit.

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
What do you think about being teased?

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes.

62
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,100
What do you think about it?

63
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,060
No, it's okay.

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
What do you think about the works so far?

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,560
What do you think about the number of models you've worked with so far?

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
Hmm, the number of models I've worked with so far...

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
Which one do you think is the most popular?

68
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,620
Hmm...

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:48,280
I think the number of models I've worked with so far is the most popular.

70
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,100


71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,660
I tend to be more aggressive.

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,560
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

73
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
Most of the time, you get attacked during your debut,

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,500
and when you get used to it, you get attacked.

75
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,360
Is that what you call the darkness of AV?

76
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,900
I guess so.

77
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,680
In the past, there were a lot of high school girls,

78
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,580
so I was often attacked.

79
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,120
But recently, I've become an adult.

80
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,940
It's been about 5 years since my debut.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
Yes, it's been about 5 years.

82
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,400
What do you like about your work?

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,920
What kind of work do you like?

84
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,820
What do you like?

85
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,960
What do I like?

86
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
What do you like about your work?

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,880
In terms of play?

88
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes, in terms of play.

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,460
I like pretty much anything.

90
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,920
I'm not that particular about what I like.

91
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,520
On the other hand, do you like anything?

92
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,380
Yes, I'm basically a pervert.

93
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,340
Basically a pervert?

94
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,600
Yes, I want to match my opponent.

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,800
You want to match your opponent?

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,780
Yes, I want to match my opponent.

97
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,220
I want to step on a man's foot.

98
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
That's a bit of an empty dream, isn't it?

99
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,380
Maybe.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,040
You don't want to step on a man's foot, do you?

101
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,640
But it sounds fun.

102
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,680
You're going to laugh at it, aren't you?

103
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,520
Yes.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,540
Yes?

105
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,480
That's weird.

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,840
That's a bit weird.

107
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
You don't do that in private, do you?

108
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,260
I do do that in private.

109
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,140
Do you cut your hair?

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,980
I'm quite...

111
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,000
You have a lot of faith in people like that?

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200
Well, it's kind of...

113
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,740
Emohoihoi.

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,400
Emohoihoi?

115
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,700
You mean Emohoku is coming to you?

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,600
That's right.

117
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,200
I see.

118
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,880
Does he look like an S?

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,760
I wonder.

120
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:23,380
How do you do it? Is it the most charming one?

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,360
Well, how do I do it? I'm looking for it.

122
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,780
I was looking for it.

123
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,980
You were looking for it?

124
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,760
Yes.

125
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,820
Can you show me yours?

126
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,700
I took a picture of it.

127
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,300
It's amazing, isn't it?

128
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,580
Your face doesn't change even if you stick out your tongue.

129
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,280
What?

130
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,200
Usually, if you stick out your tongue that much,

131
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,780
your face changes a little.

132
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,480
It's like the bottom of a flower is growing.

133
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,940
It's normal, isn't it?

134
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,220
Wow, it's moving a lot.

135
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,500
If you look a little to the side, it's like a velo.

136
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,470
Do you do it like that?

137
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,510
Do you look at the feeling of a man?

138
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,710
Yes.

139
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,310
What are you doing now?

140
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,270
Did you take your medication?

141
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,190
I'm getting tired.

142
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,610
Can you take it out from now on?

143
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,830
I'll do that from now on.

144
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,350
What about today?

145
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,370
No, I can't take it out today.

146
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,530
Really?

147
00:08:59,410 --> 00:08:59,770
You're amazing.

148
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm happy just by taking a bath.

149
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,510
Really?

150
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:04,710
Is that true?

151
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,730
You can also attack men with this body.

152
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,250
Please stand up.

153
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,820
Your body is beautiful.

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,240
Yes.

155
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,860
Normally, when I wear this, I feel like I'm in danger.

156
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,340
Do you feel like you're in danger?

157
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,820
But it's cute.

158
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,180
You have a neck.

159
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,950
Do you want me to provoke you?

160
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,270
We are also provoked.

161
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,310
Why are you standing there?

162
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,510
It's like a magic show, isn't it?

163
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,410
Wow, your butt is so nice.

164
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,890
It's so beautiful.

165
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,780
What's wrong with you?

166
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,580
What?

167
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,860
Oh, from yourself?

168
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,960
Yes.

169
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,040
Oh, good. Please show me.

170
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,030
Oh!

171
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,020
It's a little too much.

172
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,700
Yes.

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,900
Oh, it's a little too much.

174
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,870
All the staffs are on their feet.

175
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,010
It's beautiful.

176
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,510
It's beautiful, isn't it?

177
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,610
Oh, the front is also beautiful.

178
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,230
Oh, it's amazing.

179
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,230
The anime is also amazing.

180
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,470
It came out.

181
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,590
The anime is also amazing.

182
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,930
It came out.

183
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,210
It came out.

184
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,470
No, it's okay.

185
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,190
Why did you pull it in?

186
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,950
I thought it was a little bit.

187
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:43,610
No, it's okay.

188
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,570
Please take it out.

189
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,590
Will you take it out?

190
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:45,930
Yes.

191
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,550
For service.

192
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,870
Oh, you've already taken it out?

193
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,190
Yes.

194
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,650
Oh, you've already taken it out?

195
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,330
Oh, it's scary to stop here, isn't it?

196
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,910
Oh, it's scary to stop here, isn't it?

197
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,810
Oh, it's scary to stop here, isn't it?

198
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,320
Oh, it's scary to stop here, isn't it?

199
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,540
Oh, it's scary to stop here, isn't it?

200
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:20,120


201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
Is it like this?

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,820
Yes, like this.

203
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,380
Is it okay?

204
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes, it's good.

205
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,800
It's a double weapon.

206
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,120
It's like taking out a tongue.

207
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,140
It's like taking out a tongue.

208
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,580
It's like taking out a tongue.

209
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,840
There are a lot of weapons.

210
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,040
There are a lot of weapons.

211
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,270
If you don't attack with this, the guy won't like it.

212
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,030
If you don't attack with this, the guy won't like it.

213
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,100
Are you listening to me?

214
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,020
Do you want to turn around and look at your tongue in a back pose?

215
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,850
That's a good one.

216
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,330
Wow, your body is so soft.

217
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,450
My body is so soft.

218
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,490
Can you show us your favorite pose?

219
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,330
A soft pose?

220
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,850
Can you show us your favorite pose?

221
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,450
I wonder if there's anything.

222
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, you mean like this?

223
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,830
Oh, I see.

224
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Wow, that's nice.

225
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,340
And then, tongue.

226
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,130
You have a lot of weapons.

227
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:13,430
What's wrong with you?

228
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:14,830
Nothing.

229
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:15,870
Did you start wanting them?

230
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,670
Do you miss your mouth?

231
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,370
What?

232
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,820
Do you miss your mouth?

233
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:28,700
Yes.

234
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,560
If that's the case, what would you do?

235
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,940
I don't think that's a good way to say it.

236
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,640
What do you mean?

237
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,580
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,720
What do you think?

239
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,600
It's great.

240
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,860
It's great?

241
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,460
Do you like it?

242
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,120
Do you like it?

243
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,920
Yes.

244
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
Do you like it?

245
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,130
Yes.

246
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,480
Do you like it?

247
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,300
Yes.

248
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,370
Do you like it?

249
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,430
Yes.

250
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,930
Do you like it?

251
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,510
Yes.

252
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:58,570
Do you like it?

253
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:58,930
Yes.

254
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:58,950
Yes.

255
00:14:59,950 --> 00:14:59,990
Do you like it?

256
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,330
Do you like it?

257
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:00,770
Yes.

258
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,270
I like you.

259
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,870
You are a good person.

260
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,870
I am a good person.

261
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:06,770
You are a good person.

262
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,910
I want to see you.

263
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:22,130
I want to see you.

264
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,010
I've been watching you for a long time.

265
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,240
That's good.

266
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,450
Do you feel good when you sleep?

267
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,110
I want you to tell me more about you.

268
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,530
What do you want me to say?

269
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,820
It's delicious, right?

270
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,280
You look cute.

271
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,380
Does it feel good?

272
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,620
The back of my hand.

273
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,400
That's good.

274
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,080
It feels good.

275
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
Really?

276
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,580
It's so hot.

277
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,880
Yes, it is.

278
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,660
It's like crab meat.

279
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,410
It's so hot.

280
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,580
Yes, it's so hot.

281
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,500
It's like crab meat.

282
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:11,720
There's a lot of meat coming out.

283
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,140
I'm getting excited.

284
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,180
It's my line.

285
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,600
Are you getting excited?

286
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,340
It's delicious.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,980
I'm getting excited when you say that.

288
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,160
I get excited when I see you.

289
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,500
Are you excited?

290
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,260
Yes.

291
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,540
You look good.

292
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,070
I'm so tired.

293
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:02,040
Are you okay?

294
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,880
What?

295
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,780
I thought you were going to look at everything.

296
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,900
Oh, really?

297
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,320
Wow, you're so cute.

298
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,000
That's a good one.

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,260
It's good, isn't it?

300
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:46,970
It's good, isn't it?

301
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:08,070
Are you going to eat this?

302
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,580
No, no.

303
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,520
This is how you do it.

304
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes.

305
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,730
Mikan.

306
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,390
It's like this today.

307
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,850
It's like this today.

308
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,210
It's like this today.

309
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:45,370
It's like this today.

310
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,750
It's like this today.

311
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,610
It's like this.

312
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,580
Please go to your favorite nightclub.

313
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,520
Are you listening to that?

314
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,860
It stopped.

315
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,980
It's the 10th floor, isn't it?

316
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Management company.

317
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,580
What should I do?

318
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,560
Is this the right place?

319
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,100
I think I should call them.

320
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,200
Huh?

321
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,600
Huh?

322
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,080
It's a bit late.

323
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,280
Yeah.

324
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,440
This is bad.

325
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,060
Are you in a hurry?

326
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,160
Yes, I am.

327
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,440
I have to go to work in a hurry.

328
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,680
What should I do?

329
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,060
Can you move it a little bit?

330
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:23,060
It doesn't move.

331
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,440
There's no pressure button.

332
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:38,420
I wonder where it is.

333
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,490
Yes, it doesn't move.

334
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:47,850
I don't think so.

335
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,930
Can you get out of the ceiling?

336
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,770
From the ceiling?

337
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,050
Yes.

338
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,510
There are quite a few.

339
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,570
I'm going to check.

340
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,670
Can I sit down?

341
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,690
You're going to sit down?

342
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,130
Yes.

343
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,180
Are you okay?

344
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,520
Yes, I'm okay.

345
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,080
Yes, please.

346
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,520
Can you lift it?

347
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,220
Yes, I can.

348
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,140
How is it?

349
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,220
It doesn't seem to come off.

350
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,720
I see.

351
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,580
It doesn't seem to come off.

352
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,080
I see.

353
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,980
I'll put it down.

354
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,770
I'm sorry. It was heavy.

355
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,610
It's heavy, isn't it?

356
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,270
Are you okay?

357
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,560
Are you okay?

358
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,600
I'm okay.

359
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,460
Really?

360
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,480
Yes.

361
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm embarrassed to see you two together.

362
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,660
No, that's not it.

363
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,960
What should I do?

364
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm in trouble.

365
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,560
It's getting thicker.

366
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,120
I feel like I'm getting used to it.

367
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,000
I agree.

368
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:48,780
I just bought some water.

369
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,790
Are you sure?

370
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,030
Thank you very much.

371
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,150
I'm happy.

372
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,270
It's delicious.

373
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:33,720
How are you feeling?

374
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,750
I'm in trouble. I can't reach you.

375
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:48,290
What should I do?

376
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,990
I'll wait for you.

377
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:30,090
Isn't it hot?

378
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,120
It's very hot.

379
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:50,940
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,620
It's okay if it's hot.

381
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,540
Oh, because it's hot?

382
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,260
Yes.

383
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,500
Excuse me.

384
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,040
You see, you're sweating a lot.

385
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,000
It must have been hot.

386
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,240
I think it stinks.

387
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,200
Is it that bad?

388
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,640
It smells like sweat.

389
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,220
It smells like sweat.

390
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:23,680
Is a tie pretty hot?

391
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:23,980
Is it hot?

392
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,500
Yes, it is.

393
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,700
I don't know if it's because of dehydration.

394
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes, it is.

395
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:59,770
What are you doing?

396
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,880
What are you doing?

397
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,660
You asked me what I was doing.

398
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,940
What's wrong with you?

399
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,480
Is it because it's hot?

400
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,660
It's because it's hot.

401
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,120
Because it's hot?

402
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,320
It's hot, isn't it?

403
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,760
I'm sweating so much.

404
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:15,360
I'm sweating so much right now.

405
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,810
What's wrong?

406
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,560
My body is shaking.

407
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:55,910


408
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:15,790
Oh

409
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,890
I'm scared.

410
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,870
I'm scared.

411
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,030
I'm scared.

412
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,170
I'm scared.

413
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,830
I'm scared.

414
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,470
I'm scared.

415
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,910
I'm scared.

416
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,380
I'm scared.

417
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:38,380
I'm scared.

418
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:54,170
I'm scared.

419
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,760
I'm scared.

420
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm scared.

421
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm scared.

422
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,720
I'm scared.

423
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,100
You don't like it?

424
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,180
You're not serious?

425
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,150
You're just sitting there like that.

426
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,430
It's so hot.

427
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:14,350
I can feel the cow dung coming out of your mouth.

428
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:22,520
Your hands are all sticky.

429
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,240
I can taste the cow dung.

430
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm getting a lot of pimples.

431
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,480
My skin is getting really dry.

432
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,640
I'm so tired.

433
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,860
It feels good to be rubbed, right?

434
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,560
Yes, it feels good.

435
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,540
I don't know what to do.

436
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,110
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom and get it fixed.

437
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:55,390
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom and get it fixed.

438
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:04,050
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom and get it fixed.

439
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:16,920
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom and get it fixed.

440
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,840
Let's see if it's good.

441
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,960
I'm going to try a lot of different things.

442
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,600
It's good.

443
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,970
It's so hot.

444
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,590
It's so hard for me.

445
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,630
It's so hard for me.

446
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,030
It's delicious.

447
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,590
It's good, it's really good.

448
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Does it feel good?

449
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:01,640
What's going on?

450
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,280
I can't breathe.

451
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:26,730
What's going on?

452
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,560
What's going on?

453
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:48,820
I can't breathe.

454
00:48:52,460 --> 00:49:00,460


455
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,800
I don't know what I'm going to do.

456
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,580
I can't do this anymore.

457
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,100
I can't do this anymore.

458
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,670
I can't do this anymore.

459
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,610
I can't do this anymore.

460
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,470
I'm so tired.

461
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,430
I can't do this anymore.

462
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,380
I'm so tired.

463
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:05,660
I can't do this anymore.

464
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,420
I can't do this anymore.

465
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:07,820
I can't do this anymore.

466
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,980
I can't believe it's a pie.

467
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,560
I'm going to have to have a lot of ramen.

468
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,640
I'm so nervous.

469
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:24,300
I'm so nervous.

470
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:03,310


471
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,380


472
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,060


473
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:20,980


474
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,060
Ah, I have a lot of dark circles on my eyes.

475
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:56,580
What a waste.

476
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,170
My stomach is so dry.

477
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,060
It's so scary.

478
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:14,020
What are you doing?

479
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:28,580
I'm lonely.

480
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,170
No, no.

481
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:40,890
This is not good.

482
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:51,690
This is not good.

483
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,840
You don't like it?

484
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,240
How are you feeling?

485
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,500
Please stop.

486
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:20,340
Mr. Takahashi, I'm a little lonely.

487
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,980
I know that, but...

488
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:23,830


489
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:47,430
Is this it?

490
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,200
Is it hard?

491
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,860
Oh, my God.

492
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,640
Oh, my God.

493
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:37,570
I love you so much.

494
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,790
ah

495
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,610
ah

496
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,360
ah

497
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,130
ah

498
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,130
ah

499
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,410
ah

500
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:39,540
ah

501
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:39,940
ah

502
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,940
ah

503
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,900
ah

504
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,240
ah

505
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,260
ah

506
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:44,540
It's so delicious.

507
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:11,530
I think you're going to want to lick your dad's gimbap.

508
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,680
I'm going to make your dad's gimbap messy.

509
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:40,600
Your gimbap is delicious.

510
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:36,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

511
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,440
It's so hard to chew.

512
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:35,480
Does it feel good?

513
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:42,930
It looks good.

514
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:43,350
Looks like you're feeling good.

515
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:53,050
I'll give you a lot of

516
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

517
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,460
Are you feeling hot and ticklish?

518
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Do you feel like you're drooling?

519
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,040
It's all hard.

520
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:59,380
Don't you want to take a bath?

521
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:38,390
How is it?

522
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,000
How do you feel?

523
01:07:52,640 --> 01:08:00,640
My cheeks are so puffy and my nipples are so flat.

524
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,790
Please look at me a lot.

525
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:19,160
How do you feel?

526
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,960
Does this feel good?

527
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:44,060
Does it feel good to be tickled?

528
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:25,180


529
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,180
Is it too tight?

530
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,640
Can I move it to the other side?

531
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,240
It's so hard.

532
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,080
Dad, can you give me a hand?

533
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,140
Hurry up.

534
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:33,280
My butt is so tight.

535
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,520
Does it feel good?

536
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:51,320
My butt is so tight.

537
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:51,330
Do you want me to let go of your hand?

538
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:12,150
I can hear the sound of your breath.

539
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,150
I feel good when you rub my hand.

540
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,050
I feel good when I hear the sound of your breath.

541
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,990
It's getting worse.

542
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,830
Is it bad?

543
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:05,170
No.

544
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:11,920
I don't want to do it.

545
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,160
I don't want to do it.

546
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:46,520
I don't want to do it.

547
01:14:52,340 --> 01:15:00,340
I don't want to do it.

548
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,330
I don't want to do it.

549
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:14,410
I don't want to do it.

550
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,120
I don't want to do it.

551
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:16,220
I don't want to do it.

552
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,320
I don't want to do it.

553
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,040
I don't want to do it.

554
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,600
I don't want to do it.

555
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:32,240
I don't want to do it.

556
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,520
I don't want to do it.

557
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,960
Ah, it's so hard.

558
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,160
I'm going to blow on it.

559
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,520
Ah, it's so embarrassing.

560
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,500
Ah, it's so uncomfortable.

561
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:05,630
Ah, it's so uncomfortable.

562
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,160
Please look at me for a moment.

563
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:29,350
It feels so good.

564
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:40,350
Does your stomach feel good?

565
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,080
I'm so happy.

566
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,900
I hope you feel better.

567
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,890
My stomach...

568
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:14,590
I hope you feel better.

569
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:17,610
Amazing.

570
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:30,030


571
01:17:35,830 --> 01:18:00,460


572
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:03,560
I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

573
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,040
It's amazing.

574
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,100
Can you see it?

575
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,960
It's a place where you can feel good.

576
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:37,070
It's embarrassing.

577
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:45,070


578
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,870
I don't know what to do.

579
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:42,570
Oh

580
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:12,990
I don't know what I'm doing

581
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:40,130
I'm so tired

582
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,760
Oh my god.

583
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:11,100
See? It's amazing.

584
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,020
See?

585
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:45,600
Oh, my God.

586
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:45,740
Oh, I feel good.

587
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,140
I feel good, too.

588
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:54,230
I feel like my legs are going to fall off.

589
01:28:56,090 --> 01:29:04,090
Do you feel better?

590
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,000
Yes.

591
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:18,180
You've been doing this for a long time, haven't you?

592
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:18,780
Yes.

593
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,140
Like this?

594
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,640
I thought I would do it with my other hand.

595
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:38,780
Do you want me to do it with my other hand?

596
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:39,390
Yes.

597
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,710
Or do you want me to do it with my other hand?

598
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:45,150
I want to do it with my other hand too.

599
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,550
No, I want to do it like this.

600
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,320
It feels good.

601
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,980
I feel good.

602
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,120
It feels good.

603
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,400
It feels good.

604
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:49,900
I can feel it.

605
01:30:56,950 --> 01:31:01,460
I can feel it.

606
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,500
Do you feel good?

607
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,260
Do you want me to rub your head?

608
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,060
Yes, please.

609
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:20,970
Hold my hand.

610
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,240
Kiss me.

611
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:45,410
Oh, my God.

612
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:45,870
Yes.

613
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,660
Oh, my God.

614
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:27,630
Oh, my God.

615
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,310
Oh, my God.

616
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:33,230
Oh, my God.

617
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:35,450
Oh, my God.

618
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:36,510
Oh, my God.

619
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:37,890
Oh, my God.

620
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:39,130
Oh, my God.

621
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:40,290
Oh, my God.

622
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:48,470
Oh, my God.

623
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:49,270
Oh, my God.

624
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:51,870
Oh, my God.

625
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,940
Are you okay?

626
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:09,940
Yes, I feel good.

627
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,460
Your ears?

628
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:12,960
Yes.

629
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,380
Do you like it?

630
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,800
Yes, I like it.

631
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,980
Did you sleep well?

632
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:17,740
Yes.

633
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:40,920
It feels good.

634
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:51,540
It feels good.

635
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:11,370


636
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:55,350
Ah

637
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:57,770
Ah

638
01:38:57,770 --> 01:39:00,050
Ah

639
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:02,470
Ah

640
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:09,330
Ah

641
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:10,250
Ah

01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:10,610
Ah

643
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,120
Ah

644
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,780
Ah

645
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:14,600
Ah

646
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,780
Ah

01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:15,920
Ah

648
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,440
Ah

649
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,500
Do you want me to pat you on the back?

650
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:19,840
Yes.

651
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,300
Oh, that's great.

652
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,120
Chin-chin is coming back to me.

653
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:44,300
Can I pat you on the back?

654
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:49,290
Yes, sure.

655
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,440
You look like you really like it.

656
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,440
Turn around.

657
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:14,620
Like this?

658
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:16,580
Yes.

659
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:17,940
More.

660
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,340
More?

661
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,380
Yes.

662
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:25,450
Yes.

663
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,550
Does it feel good?

664
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,430
Yes.

665
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:52,810
I'm going to do it slowly.

666
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:54,170
It's clear now, isn't it?

667
01:40:58,450 --> 01:40:59,850
It's very shiny.

668
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,170
I can see it.

669
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:08,610
I'll do the same for you.

670
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:08,930
Okay.

671
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,760
Does it feel good?

672
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:24,940
Yes, it feels good.

673
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:27,460
Tintin is very shiny.

674
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:28,740
Okay.

675
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:41,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

676
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:19,240


677
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:22,820
What's wrong?

678
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:25,080
I can't breathe.

679
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,380
I can't breathe.

680
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,300
I can't breathe.

681
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:41,080
I can't breathe.

682
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,220
I can't breathe.

683
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:06,140


684
01:45:26,660 --> 01:46:06,580
Thank you.

685
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,540
Oh, my God.

686
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:32,120
Oh

687
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:57,410
Oh

688
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:56,350
It's so good.

689
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:11,770
Is the sticky rice delicious?

690
01:56:19,310 --> 01:56:21,310
I can't breathe.

691
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:24,150
I can't breathe.

692
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:27,830
I can't breathe.

693
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:46,050
Ah, it's so good.

694
01:57:57,630 --> 01:57:58,750
It's so good.

695
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:30,180


696
01:58:55,780 --> 01:59:07,250
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

697
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:08,510
Mm.

698
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:12,990
Oh.

01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:14,650
Mm-hmm.

700
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:15,050
Mm-hmm.

701
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,290
Mm.

702
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:17,430
Oh.

01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:58,770
Oh

711
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:18,940


712
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:33,670
Oh, my God.

713
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:54,050
Oh

714
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:11,690
One, two, three, four.

715
02:06:54,180 --> 02:07:02,180
I can't breathe.

716
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:21,240

I can't breathe.

721
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:02,000
I can't breathe.

722

02:16:24,090 --> 02:17:45,040


732
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:28,510
I don't know what to do.

733
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:59,390
I want you to put it in here.

Don't look at me like that.

753
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,720
Save me.

754
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:02,240
It's so good.

755
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:05,180
Oh, I'm so sorry.

756
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,640
It's all right, it's all right.

757

I'm so full.

758
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:13,260
Oh, my God.
