1
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,030
I don't know.


00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:01,080
I don't know what to do.

3
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,490
I don't know what to do.

4
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,390
I don't know what to do.

5
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,050
I don't know what to do.

6
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,750
I don't know what to do.

7
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,440
I don't know what to do.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:52,940
I don't know what to do.

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,240
I don't know what to do.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,680
I don't know what to do.

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:42,250
I don't know what to do.

12
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:50,740


13
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:58,260


14
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,960
Are you okay?

15
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,480
Are you okay?

16
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,260
Are you okay? I'm not scared.

17
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,480
How are you?

18
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,750
It smells good.

19
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,990
It smells good.

20
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,070
Oh, are you crying?

21
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,170
Don't cry.

22
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm sorry.

23
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,180
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

24
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,820
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

25
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,400
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

26
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,400
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

27
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,620
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

28
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,340
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

29
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,940
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

30
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,600
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

31
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:42,640
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

32
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:42,660
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

33
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,080
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

34
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,080
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

35
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,880
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

36
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,820
Have you been selected to monitor a new app?

37
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,440
A timer app?

38
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,120
If you use this app, can you stop time?

39
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:36,500
How to use it...

40
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,560
Activate this app and...

41
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,940
Stop and shout...

42
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Stop!

43
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,230
What?

44
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:01,900
What?

45
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,020
No way!

46
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,340
It really stopped!

47
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,220
When you want to move it,

48
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,040
you shout, move!

49
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,600
Amazing!

50
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:41,600
What can I do?

51
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,720
It's about to start.

52
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:15,400
You can't do it.

53
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,520
No, no, no, no.

54
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,880
You can't do it.

55
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,100
No, no, no, no.

56
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,640
When did you make it?

57
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,600
It's like this in a boys' high school, isn't it?

58
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
Excuse me.

59
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,940
Are you a student here?

60
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,680
You're not allowed to stand here.

61
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,280
Yes.

62
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,140
You're suspicious.

63
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,900
No, no.

64
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,420
You're suspicious.

65
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
Who are you?

66
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,780
What's wrong with you?

67
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
You're so suspicious!

68
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,740
Stop it!

69
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm going to steal your cute handkerchief.

70
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:02,970
I wonder if there's a man in the men's room.

71
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,180
I don't know if I can do this.

72
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:08,950
Shall we start?

73
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,100
Please be quiet.

74
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm going to be in charge of the class.

75
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm Meguri, a temporary teacher.

76
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,620
What?

77
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,900
What about the teacher?

78
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, the teacher...

79
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,700
Oh, I wrote it down because I wasn't feeling well.

80
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,460
What?

81
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,580
What?

82
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:26,490
First, I'll take the attendance.

83
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,170
When I was asked for my name,

84
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:38,170


85
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:55,270
Even if I touch him, he won't move at all.

86
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,470
I don't know what to do.

87
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:12,790
Well, then.

88
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,740
Everyone's day.

89
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,400
I wonder if I can observe your cute day.

90
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:46,340
I really stopped.

91
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:07,900
I wonder if he can't move.

92
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,880
He's out.

93
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,900
I'm still not excited enough.

94
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:52,870
He's got a little skin on.

95
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,660
Sato-kun, you're eating a lot.

96
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,060
Just like that.

97
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,900
Stand up straight.

98
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:27,560
See? You moved a little bit.

99
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,490
You're working out seriously.

100
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,190
You're so cute.

101
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,710
You're so cute, Gomo-chan.

102
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,120
You look like you're in good shape.

103
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,580
Ouch!

104
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,240
You stink.

105
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,700
You smell like you're going to die.

106
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,280
Even your butt.

107
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,880
You're so plump, Gomo-nee.

108
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, Kimura-kun's chinko is good, isn't it?

109
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,260
Oh, Meda-kun.

110
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,490
You have a strong pectoralis major.

111
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:58,550
A high school boy.

112
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,760
Oh, I'm naked.

113
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,960
You have a lot of gyarandu.

114
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,860
The glue is sticking to my hair so well.

115
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,810
I think this garland is connected to my penis.

116
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,730
Which one? Which one? Which one?

117
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:51,530
This is my favorite shape.

118
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:13,740
When I do this, I get excited.

119
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:31,380
When I look at such a fresh person close to me, my body gets hot.

120
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,600
Oh, Ueda-kun.

121
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:47,420
I wonder if my blood is getting stronger than before.

122
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:57,050
Even though my body is stopped, I wonder if I can hear my voice properly.

123
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,850
I wonder if you can hear my voice.

124
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:06,590
You can hear my voice, right?

125
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:15,170
I just touched it a little bit.

126
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,990
More and more.

127
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,590
It's becoming a right angle.

128
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,550
90 degrees. This is 90 degrees.

129
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,050
I can see it clearly.

130
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,050
Sato-kun's penis is bigger than mine.

131
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,720
As usual, I'm standing up all the time.

132
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm scared.

133
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,760
I'm so scared.

134
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:27,040
I get nervous when I'm surrounded by the kids.

135
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I want to be able to observe everyone's behavior.

136
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:10,170
I want to feel good.

137
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:58,630


138
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,620
The sound is so good.

139
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,120
Oh, the golden egg.

140
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,620
It looks like there's a lot of sage in it.

141
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:22,020
I want to lick it.

142
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,180
I want to lick it.

143
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,360
I want to make it.

144
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:50,740
I don't want to. Manjiru came out.

145
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,100
Manjiru

146
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,060
Manjiru

147
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,690
I'll give it to you.

148
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,590
I wonder if I'll give it to Manjiru.

149
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,650
I don't want to. Manjiru came out a lot.

150
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,400
You're so cute.

151
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm starting to feel better.

152
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,680
I saw everything.

153
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,180
I can't stop.

154
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm jealous.

155
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,050
I'm going to be a teacher.

156
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,710
I have a lot of things to do in the future.

157
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:28,850
I just tried it and it felt good.

158
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:09,360
It's the best.

159
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,940
My manko is dirty.

160
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,250
Well, Iko-chan.

161
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,550
Everyone.

162
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:44,970
Oh no! Ueda-kun, your tongue is sticking out.

163
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,740
Why are you sticking out your tongue?

164
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:04,180
I wonder if I can clean my dirty dog with my mouth.

165
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,110
I wonder if I can have you clean it up with my own hands.

166
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,980
Your lips are so soft.

167
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,020
You have a lot of flesh, Satou-kun.

168
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,420
I can feel my clitoris being stimulated by these two thick lips.

169
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:58,610
Wow, it feels so good.

170
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,220
Next is Ueda-kun, who is looking forward to it.

171
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,700
Was it Kimura-kun? I forgot.

172
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,780
Who is it?

173
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,060
Haru-kun?

174
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Why are you putting your tongue out?

175
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,150
You're so mean.

176
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:17,110
You smell like my mean baby.

177
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,340
I want to make you feel better.

178
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,420
I'm so ticklish.

179
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,540
I'm going to pass out.

180
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,760
What should I do?

181
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:24,380
I can't stop crying.

182
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:43,100
I've been waiting for you.

183
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,810
I've been waiting for you.

184
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,030
What is it?

185
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,610
Here.

186
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,810
I've been waiting for you.

187
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,210
Manco.

188
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,070
Manco.

189
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,890
Manco.

190
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,440
It's so hot.

191
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
It's so warm.

192
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,400
It's so warm.

193
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
It feels so good.

194
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,850
My man-jiru is all over the place.

195
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,790
Please take it in your mouth.

196
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:26,330
I'm going to take a picture of you guys.

197
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:37,150
I want to take a picture of all of you guys.

198
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:46,450
I want to do it.

199
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:11,580
I can't do it.

200
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I used a lot of my hips, so I'm sweating a lot.

201
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:33,380
It smells so oily.

202
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:45,900
It smells so sour.

203
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,620
It smells so sour.

204
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,660
I think I'm sweating the most.

205
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,560
My forehead is sweating so much.

206
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:07,960
It smells so good.

207
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
It stinks.

208
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:39,650
I don't know what to do with my face.

209
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:51,150
It smells like men right now.

210
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:12,770
I don't want to do this.

211
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:37,160
I don't want to do this.

212
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,180
I don't want to do this.

213
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,660
I don't want to do this.

214
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,220
I don't want to do this.

215
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,120
I don't want to do this.

216
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,460
I don't want to do this.

217
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,620
I don't want to do this.

218
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,180
I don't want to do this.

219
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,400
I don't want to do this.

220
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,180
I don't want to do this.

221
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,340
I don't want to do this.

222
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,580
Shin, why are you working out with no underwear?

223
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,080
Hey, why?

224
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,100
It's smelly.

225
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,500
See, I'm not wearing any underwear.

226
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,160
The smell of sweat soaked into the jersey.

227
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,720
The smell of sweat and the smell of this little sweat, it's so smelly.

228
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,480
I want to take a look at my feet.

229
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,480
Too smelly.

230
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,460
I'm sweating so much that I'm drooling.

231
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:26,140
I'm going to take a lot of drool and drink it.

232
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,110
I'm sweating so much that I'm drooling.

233
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,510
You're sweating a lot, aren't you?

234
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,390
You're all sweating a lot.

235
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:17,330


236
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:50,160


237
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,980
I'm going to get a lot of it.

238
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:15,580
I'm starting to get a little hot, too.

239
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,140
Hey, I'm back from the morning.

240
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,380
Let's take a bath together.

241
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,230
Let's take a bath together.

242
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:57,260
What a great view.

243
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:38,560


244
00:45:45,350 --> 00:46:03,480
In my case, I'm going to play with my sweaty, smelly t-shirt.

245
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,020
Look.

246
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,660
I'm being played with.

247
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,040
Like this.

248
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,020
I don't like it.

249
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,930
I got stung in the nipple.

250
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,570
It feels so good.

251
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
I'm starting to miss other cats.

252
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,620
Hey, you.

253
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,960
Hey, you.

254
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,720
Ah, wait a minute.

255
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,980
It smells so bad.

256
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,600
How is it?

257
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,700
Show me.

258
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,300
You have to take off your underwear.

259
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,100
I'm going to take off my pants.

260
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,660
Oh my god.

261
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,530
Why?

262
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,860
Why did you make me stiff while I was working out?

263
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,640
You're so handsome.

264
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,720
You're so handsome.

265
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:59,140
That's good. You have a lot of power, Jinpo.

266
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,300
What do you think, Jinpo?

267
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,860
Oh, my God.

268
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,340
Oh, my God.

269
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,560
Oh, my God.

270
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,300
Oh, my God.

271
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,260
Oh, my God.

272
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,900
Oh, my God.

273
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,120
Oh, my God.

274
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,040
Oh, my God.

275
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,280
Oh, my God.

276
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,560
Oh, my God.

277
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,780
Oh, my God.

278
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,280
Oh, my God.

279
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,580
It's so sour!

280
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,450
I'm going to use my waist

281
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,270
I'm going to use my waist

282
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:02,530
I'm going to use my waist

283
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,070
I don't want to

284
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,790
I don't want to

285
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,710
I can't see

286
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,230
I can't see

287
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,650
I can't see

288
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,590
I can't see

289
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:18,850
I can't see

290
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,630
I can't see

291
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,790
I can't see

292
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,730
I can't see

293
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,960
I can't open my arms and spread them out like this.

294
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,400
I look like a baby, don't I?

295
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:59,660
I look so mean.

296
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,500
I can't do this anymore.

297
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:22,940
I can't do this anymore.

298
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
I can't do this anymore.

299
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,560
I can't move.

300
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,480
I can't do this anymore.

301
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,600
I can't do this anymore.

302
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:38,980
I can't do this anymore.

303
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,680
I can't do this anymore.

304
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,160
I can't do this anymore.

305
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,280
I can't do this anymore.

306
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,740
Oh, my God!

307
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,220
Oh, my God!

308
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,140
Oh, my God!

309
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,080
Oh, my God!

310
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,520
Oh, my God!

311
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,260
Oh, my God!

312
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,460
Oh, my God!

313
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,300
Oh, my God!

314
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,020
Oh, my God!

315
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,600
Oh, my God!

316
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,680
Oh, my God!

317
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,940
Oh, my God!

318
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,100
Oh, my God!

319
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:17,070
I can't take it anymore.

320
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,930
I can't take it anymore.

321
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:24,490
I can't take it anymore.

322
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,610
I can't take it anymore.

323
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,290
I can't take it anymore.

324
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,970
I can't take it anymore.

325
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,010
I can't take it anymore.

326
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:42,890
I can't take it anymore.

327
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,070
I can't take it anymore.

328
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:44,250
I can't take it anymore.

329
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:44,610
What are you doing?

330
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,390
Your gimbap?

331
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:52,670
It stinks!

332
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,850
You're such a thief!

333
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,710
You're such a thief!

334
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,810
Your gimbap!

335
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,190
Oh, it's so good.

336
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:29,990
It's so good.

337
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:30,070
So good.

338
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:40,470
I love it.

339
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:52,250


340
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,720
I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore.

341
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:12,040


342
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,520
Ow!

343
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,460
Ow!

344
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,390
Ow!

345
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:06,930
Ow!

346
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,610
Ow!

347
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,830
Ow!

348
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,170
You too. You can feel better now, okay?

349
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:36,340
My chest is getting harder and harder.

350
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,900
It's getting harder and harder.

351
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,260
What? What? I'm going to get tired and come out, right?

352
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,320
Hey, it's getting harder and harder.

353
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,920
Hey...

354
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,100
Oh, I'm sorry I left you.

355
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,600
Oh, that's amazing.

356
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:18,160


357
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,100
Thank you, thank you.

358
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:26,060


359
00:57:52,380 --> 00:58:21,420


360
00:58:21,420 --> 00:59:06,410


361
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,790
Thank you Pai-sensei!

362
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,250
Well then...

363
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,230
Move!

364
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:31,670
What's wrong?

365
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,800
What's wrong?

366
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,560
What's wrong?

367
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,000
Where's the health care worker?

368
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,380
I need to take a break.

369
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,180
I'll be right back.

370
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,780
He seems to be in a bad mood.

371
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,300
Please let him rest.

372
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,380
Is that so?

373
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,320
What?

374
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,420
It's nothing.

375
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,700
Let's go to bed.

376
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,040
Let's rent a bed.

377
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:14,940
Yes.

378
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,740
Then lie down on the bed here.

379
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,590
Are you okay?

380
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,890
You're on a date after school, aren't you?

381
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:33,050
I was going to go to her house for the first time today.

382
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,090
Are you going to graduate from the same school as me?

383
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,830
I said I didn't have parents.

384
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:46,370
I said I wouldn't be able to do it, so maybe that's what will happen.

385
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,210


386
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,030
Oh, it's not good if you're late for the time being.

387
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,150
I hope you get better.

388
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,250
Stop.

389
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:07,650
Stop it!

390
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:15,910
Here you go.

391
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:25,810
This is the first time I've experienced this kind of bust.

392
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,550
It's a waste.

393
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,160
I'll steal your bust.

394
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,740
You're really my type.

395
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,880


396
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,820
Which one? Where?

397
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,080
Where's the bottom?

398
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,260
Oh, there it is.

399
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,400
Oh, it's so annoying.

400
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,360
Oh, it's getting longer and longer.

401
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,820
The next one is from Dotei.

402
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,520
It's this sticky one.

403
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:56,410
I'm going to take a good look at your body.

404
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:06,510
I didn't get to eat it, but I have to eat it first.

405
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,970
It has a very clear shape.

406
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,790
It's a good shape.

407
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:20,710
I like the other faces, but I also like Chinko.

408
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:24,850
I'm going to be a type of Chinko.

409
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,850
It's so good.

410
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,710
Which one? Which one? Which one?

411
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,680
It's so good.

412
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,980
The curry is so crispy and looks so good.

413
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,020
It looks so good.

414
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:10,630


415
01:06:27,850 --> 01:07:21,520
I don't know what to do.

416
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:34,880
I want to swallow it all up in one gulp.

417
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:55,020
This is so disgusting.

418
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:07,170
Can you look at me for a second?

419
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:13,550
Move!

420
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,430
What are you doing?

421
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,430
What are you doing?

422
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:20,210
What are you doing?

423
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,330
What are you doing?

424
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:21,430
What are you doing?

425
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,090
What are you doing?

426
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:23,730
What are you doing?

427
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:23,990
What are you doing?

428
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,330
What are you doing?

429
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:24,390
Stop!

430
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:32,390


431
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:39,140


432
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:45,350
I can't do this anymore.

433
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:14,980
I'm going to ask you to make me feel better.

434
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,990
You can see it from there, right?

435
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,890
You can see it, right?

436
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,020
Don't you think so?

437
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,000
Don't you think so?

438
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,220
This is a girl's egg.

439
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,100
Look at this nasty mouth.

440
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,280
I'm going to do it with my mouth.

441
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:24,180
I'm going to do it with my mouth.

442
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,920
I'm going to put a lot of this on my face.

443
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:29,900
Look, look.

444
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,660
I don't want to.

445
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:42,980
I'm sorry.

446
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:51,970
I'm sorry.

447
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:18,180
If time stops, will I be able to say I love you?

448
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,120
I'm so happy.

449
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,960
Hey, you like him, don't you?

450
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,200
You like him, don't you?

451
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:05,660
You like him, don't you?

452
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,980
You like him, don't you?

453
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,230
You like him, don't you?

454
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:22,230
You like him, don't you?

455
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,820
This way, please.

456
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:48,500


457
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:07,200


458
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,090
You look so happy.

459
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:30,530
You're so cute.

460
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,250
Wait a minute.

461
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I want you to do it more comfortably.

462
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,830
Here.

463
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,130
Here.

464
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:30,310
It hurts.

465
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:41,900
I can't do this.

466
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:48,700
My fingers hurt so much.

467
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,760
I can't take it anymore.

468
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,920
I can't take it anymore.

469
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:14,920
I can't take it anymore.

470
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:29,450
I can't take it anymore.

471
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,730
I can't take it anymore.

472
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,170
I can't take it anymore.

473
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,410
I can't take it anymore.

474
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:34,310
I can't take it anymore.

475
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,650
I can't take it anymore.

476
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,770
I can't take it anymore.

477
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:39,410
I can't take it anymore.

478
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,310
I can't take it anymore.

479
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,930
I can't take it anymore.

480
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:46,330
Let's do this.

481
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,720
I don't want to.

482
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:01,260
You can't see my sexy anal-marumie, can you?

483
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:06,740
I'm so excited.

484
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:23,380
My index finger is growling.

485
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,780
I can't do this anymore...

486
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:37,080
Why does it get so weird?

487
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,260
I'm starting to get a cramp.

488
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,260
If I put my finger in the egg, it gets a cramp.

489
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,700
I'm so sorry.

490
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:47,850
Hey, let's get married, okay?

491
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,290
I want to be with you.

492
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,030
Don't leave me.

493
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:05,650
You're my first baby.

494
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,210
You're a baby, aren't you?

495
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,010
You're a baby, aren't you?

496
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:16,750
You're a baby, aren't you?

497
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:45,060
You're a baby, aren't you?

498
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:50,280
You're a baby, aren't you?

499
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,440
You're a baby, aren't you?

500
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,360
You're a baby, aren't you?

501
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,900
You're a baby, aren't you?

502
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:56,620
You're a baby, aren't you?

503
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:56,640
You're a baby, aren't you?

504
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,360
You're a baby, aren't you?

505
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,160
You're a baby, aren't you?

506
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:10,160


507
01:21:43,180 --> 01:22:13,530
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

508
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:33,810
I got you, so I won't let go of you anymore.

509
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,570
I won't let go of you anymore.

510
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:43,030
Just like this. Just like this.

511
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:48,930
From the back. From the back.

512
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,870
Look at your friends properly.

513
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,790
Just like this.

514
01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:04,260
Mom, stop it.

515
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:27,440
I'm going to do it in 10 steps.

516
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:56,880
You can't do it anymore, can you?

517
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,910
You have to do it well.

518
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:42,010
I don't want to do this. I'm going to die.

519
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:43,390
I'm going to die.

520
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,380
It's painful.

521
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:18,820
Look. I want to feel it more.

522
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:44,950
Look. It's sticky.

523
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,830
My nipples are sticky.

524
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,620
What's wrong with my nipples?

525
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:05,180
It hurts.

526
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:25,990


527
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:25,500
I was trying to run away, but I can't run away anymore.

528
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:26,820
Move!

529
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:34,820
Okay.

530
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,970
I can't run away, can I?

531
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,230
I can't run away, can I?

532
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:46,730
I can't run away, can I?

533
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:48,030
I can't run away, can I?

534
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:50,390
I can't run away, can I?

535
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:55,510
I can't run away, can I?

536
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:59,630
I can't run away, can I?

537
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:07,630
I can't run away, can I?

538
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,940
I can't run away, can I?

539
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,380
I can't run away, can I?

540
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,040
I can't run away, can I?

541
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,180
I want to move on.

542
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,180
I want to move on.

543
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,620
I have to take care of myself.

544
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:47,040
I'm watching you from behind.

545
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:52,100
I'm watching you from behind, my friends, and I'm feeling good.

546
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:10,250
I'm so nervous.

547
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:39,620


548
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:26,350
I can't take it anymore.

549
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:27,910
I can't take it anymore.

550
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,910
I can't take it anymore.

551
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,470
I can't take it anymore.

552
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:03,690
I can't take it anymore.

553
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,230
I can't take it anymore.

554
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:05,530
I can't take it anymore.

555
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,280
I can't take it anymore.

556
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:09,820
I can't take it anymore.

557
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:10,420
I can't take it anymore.

558
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:10,580
I can't take it anymore.

559
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:11,340
I can't take it anymore.

560
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,160
I can't take it anymore.

561
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,340
I can't take it anymore.

562
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:22,050
I want to see it for a little while.

563
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:24,750
Please look at it for a little while.

564
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:36,850
Please look into your friend's eyes.

565
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,710
It's annoying.

566
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:40,290
I'm sorry.

567
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:45,770
It's a shame that I'm not your first girlfriend.

568
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,590
If you have a child, I'll take responsibility for it.

569
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:53,290
What are you talking about?

570
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,590
I'm going to take a picture of you and your girlfriend.

571
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,070
Don't move.

572
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:00,030
Please forgive me.

573
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,130
I'll take a picture of you and your girlfriend.

574
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:11,990
I'm going to put Seiji in it, too.

575
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:14,030
Pose.

576
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,080
Make sure you smile.

577
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,320
That's good.

578
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:25,740
Let's take a picture together.

579
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:32,360
Chinpo and Seiji and me.

580
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:35,880
Like this.

581
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,240
That's how it is.

582
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,600
Then I'll have to send this to my girlfriend.

583
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:48,040
I wonder if it's this one.

584
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:51,500
Send.

585
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,000
I've sent it.

586
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,840
I'm sorry, my girlfriend.

587
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:06,330
I can't believe it.

588
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:06,910
Look at this.

589
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,570
It's about to start.

590
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:10,130
It's a new anime.

591
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:12,710
It's a new anime.

592
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:15,730
It has big boobs.

593
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:17,330
It's super cute.

594
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,110
I'm going to marry an anime character.

595
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:21,110
That doesn't make any sense.

596
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:22,910
What are you talking about?

597
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:48,830
What is it?

598
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:59,190
It's not good to escape reality.

599
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:00,050
It's not a good thing.

600
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:12,030
I'll teach you how good Nami is.

601
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:17,150
I'll teach you how to do it.

602
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:35,230
Do you watch anime all the time?

603
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:36,390
What are you looking at?

604
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:42,070
Oh, you can't do that.

605
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:46,830
The two-dimensional world?

606
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,210
That's right.

607
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:56,330
The two-dimensional world...

608
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,450
doesn't come close like this, does it?

609
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:30,360
I wonder if my sister's boobs have been hit.

610
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,830
The boobs are big, right?

611
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,370
I like big boobs.

612
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:48,370
You like it, don't you?

613
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:53,870
It's raw meat, so you can touch it.

614
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:05,890
It's soft.

615
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:16,270
You can touch a lot.

616
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:27,850


617
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:45,690
When I thought I'd never see a woman again,

618
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:53,930
I just touched my boobs and it got so stiff.

619
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:08,030
It's all gone now, isn't it?

620
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:29,440
I wish I could...

621
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,080
...taste the freshness of a woman.

622
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:42,560
It's gone.

623
01:39:50,230 --> 01:39:51,770
It's my real boobs.

624
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,630
My real boobs are falling off.

625
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,530
And my nipples too.

626
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,310
They're bulging out.

627
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:02,850
Can you tell?

628
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:17,660
How is it?

629
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:33,120
It's bulging out.

630
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:36,480
I'll show you a little bit more.

631
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:44,230
Show me a little bit more.

632
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,930
Don't move your body.

633
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:50,110
Look at your knees.

634
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,850
Stand on your knees as they are.

635
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:04,110
I love your boobs.

636
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:12,650
Look at your face.

637
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:16,130
You love your boobs, don't you?

638
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:19,730
I love your boobs.

639
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:33,330
I'm sorry.

640
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:33,790
Please puff more.

641
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:35,550
Puff, puff.

642
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:36,170
Do you want me to do it for you?

643
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:51,370
I'll do it properly with my mouth.

644
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,530
I love you.

645
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:00,150
Big boobs.

646
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:02,350
Big boobs.

647
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:13,650


648
01:42:48,290 --> 01:43:25,630


649
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:27,070
Move!

650
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:07,200
I think I'm going to go to bed now.

651
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,280
I don't know what to do.

652
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:25,620
It's amazing.

653
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:36,240
My body is so fresh.

654
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:43,900
It's so big.

655
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:49,840
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

656
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,720
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

657
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,380
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

658
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:02,980
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

659
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,860
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

660
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:09,900
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

661
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:10,220
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

662
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:10,500
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

663
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,360
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

664
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,200
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

665
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:14,780
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

666
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:23,240
I don't know how to say it in Japanese.

667
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,800
How does it feel?

668
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,700
It's my first time.

669
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,380
It's so warm.

670
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:01,700
This is called a breast breast.

671
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:05,660
Look at this.

672
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:11,940
I think this is the inside of a mango.

673
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:19,840
I want you to feel good.

674
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,180
I'll wrap you in a mango.

675
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:36,120
I want you to feel good.

676
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,800
I want you to feel good.

677
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:53,500
I feel like my nipples are being sucked into my boobs.

678
01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:04,980
I want to be more comfortable.

679
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:14,710
You want to feel good, don't you?

680
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:25,430
It's okay to feel good.

681
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:32,400
It's a place where your boobs feel good.

682
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:38,260
My boobs are so tight.

683
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:50,400
I don't like my nipples.

684
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:55,780
I can feel my nipples moving, too.

685
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:06,200
It's too bad. You want to see it, don't you?

686
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:13,280
You want to see what's going on with your nipples, don't you?

687
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,260
Then I'll show you.

688
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,440
Move!

689
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:23,520
No!

690
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,080
No!

691
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,020
No!

692
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:26,500
No!

693
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:26,840
No!

694
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,400
No!

695
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:27,560
No!

696
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:27,800
No!

697
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,180
No!

698
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:28,400
No!

699
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,020
No!

700
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:29,500
It's better to be in the 2nd dimension!

701
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:32,380
What are you talking about?

702
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:33,200
You can't do that!

703
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,460
Don't make me feel good!

704
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:36,840
It's better to be in the 2nd dimension!

705
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:42,280
Don't make me feel good!

706
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:46,580
Don't make me feel good!

707
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,000
Don't make me feel good!

708
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,980
Don't make me feel good!

709
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,440
Don't make me feel good!

710
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,680
Don't make me feel good!

711
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,040
Don't make me feel good!

712
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,420
Don't make me feel good!

713
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:59,000
Don't make me feel good!

714
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:07,960
If you're so flustered...

715
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:09,260
See?

716
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:11,120
This is what you've become.

717
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,240
It's okay.

718
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:40,050


719
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:41,450
It's so smelly, look at it.

720
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:47,870
It's so gross.

721
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:50,690
The body of a virgin.

722
01:50:58,170 --> 01:51:00,110
It's so sticky.

723
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:05,210
It's so sticky.

724
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:10,490
What should I do?

725
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:15,590
From now on, I'm going to be with a girl named Namami.

726
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:18,570
It's going to be so nice.

727
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:20,470
Look.

728
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:22,370
Let me see.

729
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:27,770
Move.

730
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,660
What are you doing?

731
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:39,860
Are you stupid?

732
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,540
What are you doing?

733
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:44,890
What are you doing?

734
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:46,910
What are you doing?

735
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:51,410
I'm going to do something with your breasts.

736
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:04,090
I'll teach you how to do it.

737
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:05,890
Actually, let's have sex.

738
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:07,550
What?

739
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:08,210
Really?

740
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:09,310
Yes.

741
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:11,930
Okay, let's go upstairs.

742
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:12,530
Okay.

743
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,910
Take off your pants.

744
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:23,960
Stand up.

745
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,420
Sensei.

746
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:28,100
This is not a joke.

747
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:29,520
I didn't do it.

748
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,920
Sensei, let's do it for the last time.

749
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:33,880
What do you think?

750
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:37,720
Sensei is always shy.

751
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,780
I want to get pregnant with everyone's baby!

752
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:47,740
Let's go!

753
01:53:55,500 --> 01:54:03,500
I really can't stop.

754
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:47,780
Move!

755
01:55:53,160 --> 01:56:01,160
I can't move right now.

756
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:10,970
I want to do whatever I want to do.

757
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:18,970
I want to do whatever I want to do.

758
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:21,330
I'm going to do it for you.

759
01:56:26,910 --> 01:56:34,910
You have a thick chin.

760
01:56:39,370 --> 01:56:44,910
Don't you want to pinch me?

761
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:45,630
It's not like that, is it?

762
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:57,810
You've been looking at my boobs all the time, haven't you?

763
01:56:58,190 --> 01:57:01,770
At the very front seat.

764
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:07,030
You know that, don't you?

765
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:22,140
I brought it for you.

766
01:57:29,950 --> 01:57:37,950
You're going to react, aren't you?

767
01:57:41,690 --> 01:57:43,530
Then, this is...

768
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:22,740
It's getting bigger and bigger.

769
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,900
What are you moving?

770
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:27,600
Can you move your body a little bit?

771
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:36,200
You are such a sexy girl

772
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,140
Chikubi is so cute.

773
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:26,450
Chikubi is so cute.

774
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,400
Chikubi is so cute.

775
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:33,600
It's so good.

776
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:54,310
This is it.

777
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:57,370
This is it.

778
01:59:57,850 --> 01:59:59,730
It's my favorite.

779
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,310
It's so good.

780
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:23,670
I'm going to pee.

781
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:25,270
I'm going to pee.

782
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:28,930
Look.

783
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:32,590
Look at my feet.

784
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:42,270
I'm going to pee.

785
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:51,190
I don't know if I'll be able to do it.

786
02:01:41,770 --> 02:01:49,770
I'm going to get a new pair of jeans.

787
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:57,450
I'm going to get a new pair of jeans.

788
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:06,010
I'm going to get a new pair of jeans.

789
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:51,690
I have to know more about women's bodies.

790
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:18,550
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

791
02:03:50,190 --> 02:03:58,100
You love me, don't you?

792
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:06,980
I want to look at you, don't you?

793
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:30,340


794
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:00,260
I can do it!

795
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:05,110
I can do it!

796
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:10,950
I can do it!

797
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:15,810
I can do it!

798
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:19,770
I can do it!

799
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:21,610
I can do it!

800
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:48,920
I can do it!

801
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:52,140
I can do it!

802
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:53,680
I can do it!

803
02:05:53,880 --> 02:06:01,880
I can do it!

804
02:06:06,410 --> 02:06:14,410


805
02:06:52,150 --> 02:06:53,930
I can't do this anymore.

806
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:58,870
I can't do this anymore.

807
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:02,510
I can't do this anymore.

808
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:05,290
I can't do this anymore.

809
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:06,950
I can't do this anymore.

810
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:17,230
I can't do this anymore.

811
02:07:17,230 --> 02:07:17,470
I can't do this anymore.

812
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:18,070
I can't do this anymore.

813
02:07:18,070 --> 02:07:18,110
I can't do this anymore.

814
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:18,650
I can't do this anymore.

815
02:07:18,650 --> 02:07:20,830
I can't do this anymore.

816
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:22,290
I can't do this anymore.

817
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:26,450
I can't do this anymore.

818
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:05,840
Wait a minute.

819
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:13,500
It's so embarrassing.

820
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:15,900
It's so embarrassing.

821
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:21,180
Which one?

822
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:22,200
Which one, which one?

823
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:23,500
Which one?

824
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:26,200
All of them.

825
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:36,240
Awww

826
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:50,050
I'm such a human being.

827
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:53,570
Please put me in your belly.

828
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,790
I don't know what to do.

829
02:09:14,030 --> 02:09:15,490
I don't know what to do.

830
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:21,970
I can't do this anymore.

831
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:24,950
Wait a minute.

832
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:27,330
Wait a minute.

833
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,380
It's so hard.

834
02:09:53,600 --> 02:10:01,600
But I'm still in the middle of a sex education, so what should I do?

835
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:08,460
Do you want to put it in raw? Do you want to put this on?

836
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:12,240
You want to put it in raw, don't you?

837
02:10:34,150 --> 02:10:42,150
This is what I prepared for you.

838
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:53,190
This is a good one.

839
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:55,190
There's a back and a front.

840
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:55,590
I have a lot of things to do.

841
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:22,800
Let's go to the teacher's room.

842
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:36,350
Do you want to put it in?

843
02:12:05,410 --> 02:12:08,810
Give it to me.

844
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:47,630
I want to see it, but I can't see it.

845
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:18,690
I'm going to take this condom off, isn't it?

846
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:26,490
I'm going to take it off, aren't I?

847
02:13:29,050 --> 02:13:31,450
You like it raw, don't you?

848
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:34,750
You like it raw, don't you?

849
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:37,050
I like it raw, too.

850
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:39,710
Then, wait a minute.

851
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:55,480
This is better.

852
02:13:55,480 --> 02:14:01,650
I feel like I'm having a hard time with my hands.

853
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:08,130
I feel like I'm going to puke.

854
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:17,310
I feel like I'm going to puke.

855
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:25,660
It feels good.

856
02:14:30,910 --> 02:14:33,510
Chimpo-chan, you're doing great.

857
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,500
You're doing great.

858
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:51,600
Look at the back of your head.

859
02:14:58,390 --> 02:15:00,950
Chimpo-chan, you're doing great.

860
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:12,750
Chimpo-chan, you're doing great.

861
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:15,230
Chimpo-chan, you're holding my hand all the time.

862
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:16,130
It's weird, isn't it, Jinpo?

863
02:15:17,870 --> 02:15:23,250
It's about time...

864
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:25,430
Move!

865
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:28,710
No, no, no!

866
02:15:44,110 --> 02:15:48,680
I don't like this, everyone.

867
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:57,850
It feels good, doesn't it?

868
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:06,280
When you feel good, what do you say?

869
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:07,480
Move!

870
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:17,710
You're still going, aren't you?

871
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:23,240
Hey, you were about to leave, weren't you?

872
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:24,320
See?

873
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,580
It's no good, isn't it?

874
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:37,590
It's your turn, Ueda-kun.

875
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:47,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

876
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,060
Ueda-kun, let's go.

877
02:16:56,060 --> 02:17:04,060
I want to put my feet in the water.

878
02:17:05,870 --> 02:17:06,130
I want to put my feet in the water.

879
02:17:12,130 --> 02:17:13,930
I want to put my feet in the water.

880
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:20,440
I want to put my feet in the water.

881
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:21,980
I want to put my feet in the water.

882
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:22,680
I want to put my feet in the water.

883
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:22,720
I want to put my feet in the water.

884
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:23,500
Please.

885
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,520
I can't believe I'm doing this all by myself.

886
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:28,480
I'm so tired.

887
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:44,810
I'm so tired.

888
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:06,710
I feel like I'm going to pass out.

889
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:14,490
I'm going to do this properly.

890
02:18:14,490 --> 02:18:15,470
I think I'm going to have to add some more

891
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:29,280
I'm going to have to add some more

892
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:02,460
I'm going to have to add some more

893
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:10,460
I'm going to have to add some more

894
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,760
I'm going to have to add some more

895
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:20,920
I'm going to add some more

896
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:21,580
I'm going to add some more

897
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:25,730
I'm going to add some more

898
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:25,750
I'm going to add some more

899
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:26,910
I'm going to add some more

900
02:19:26,910 --> 02:19:27,110
I'm going to add some more

901
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:31,360
I'm going to add some more

902
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:33,020
I'm going to add some more

903
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:34,460
I'm going to add some more

904
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:45,600
I'm going to add some more

905
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:12,370


906
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:13,970
I don't have it, so please give it to me.

907
02:21:25,870 --> 02:21:27,290
I want it.

908
02:21:28,290 --> 02:21:29,590
I want it.

909
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:30,330
I want it.

910
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:32,650
Please give it to me.

911
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:35,610
I'm sorry.

912
02:21:56,340 --> 02:22:04,340
Wait a minute.

913
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:15,950
It hurts, doesn't it?

914
02:22:30,370 --> 02:22:31,730
I'm getting old, aren't I?

915
02:22:32,030 --> 02:22:40,030
I'm getting old, aren't I?

916
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:09,130
I'm getting old, aren't I?

917
02:23:09,490 --> 02:23:10,570
I'm getting old, aren't I?

918
02:23:10,570 --> 02:23:12,270
I'm getting old, aren't I?

919
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:14,250
I'm getting old, aren't I?

920
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:19,700
I'm getting old, aren't I?

921
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:27,700
I'm getting old, aren't I?

922
02:23:32,850 --> 02:23:40,850
