1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,940
Oh


00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,470
Oh

3
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:21,870
I don't know.

4
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,940
Oh, my God.

5
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:33,490
Oh

6
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:57,920


7
00:27:07,780 --> 00:28:00,570


8
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:00,870


9
00:28:00,870 --> 00:42:27,840


10
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:37,900
Oh

11
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,300
Oh

12
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,430
It's hot.

13
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,410
It's hot.

14
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:40,170
Your hips are moving.

15
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,370
It's not sweat.

16
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,410
What is this?

17
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,930
I don't know.

18
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,210
Look at me.

19
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:53,850
Look.

20
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:08,350
Look at me.

21
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:03,690
I'm sorry.

22
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,590
You're sweating more on your back than on your back.

23
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,290
Here.

24
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:16,450
Don't move.

25
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,610
You can move now.

26
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,010
You can move now.

27
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,010
You can move now.

28
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:26,550
You can move now.

29
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,310
You can move now.

30
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,230
You can move now.

31
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,250
You can move now.

32
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:45,330


33
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:58,390


34
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:05,790


35
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,150
Uhhh...

36
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,110
Uhhh...

37
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,800
Uhhh...

38
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,080
Uhhh...

39
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,280
Uhhh...

40
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,980
Uhhh...

41
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,340
Uhhh...

42
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,340
Uhhh...

43
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,700
Uhhh...

44
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,400
Uhhh...

45
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,100
Uhhh...

46
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,340
Uhhh...

47
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,620
Uhhh...

48
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:13,090
What's going on with you, Senko?

49
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,850
I can't breathe.

50
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,370
Do you want to pee?

51
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:19,500
Oh

52
00:55:55,430 --> 00:56:03,430


53
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:59,970
It's okay, it's okay.

54
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:21,180
What's the matter with you?

55
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,600
Dad...

56
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:11,600
Why are you doing this?

57
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:29,230
I can't...

58
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:43,790
You can't?

59
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,710
I can't...

60
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:52,680
I can't...

61
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,640
I can't...

62
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:24,060


63
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:44,050


64
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:57,650
Oh

65
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:08,420
Put your hands out.

66
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,280
Put your hands out.

67
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,740
Put your hands out.

68
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,900
Oh, it's hard.

69
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:22,360
Oh, it's hard.

70
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:33,630
Oh, it's hard.

71
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,050
Oh, it's hard.

72
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,440
Oh, it's hard.

73
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:08,890
Oh, it's hard.

74
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:11,290
It's hard.

75
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:11,790
It's hard.

76
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:14,890
It's hard.

77
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,090
Oh, it's hard.

78
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,970
Oh, it's hard.

79
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:14,690
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

80
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,060
Don't do it.

81
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,820
Don't do it.

82
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,560
Wait a second.

83
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,120
Don't do it.

84
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,360
Don't do it.

85
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:34,010
Are you okay?

86
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:35,690
Don't do it.

87
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,860
Stretch it out.

88
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,160
That's right.

89
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,420
Do you feel it?

90
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,480
Do you feel it when you stretch it out?

91
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:58,860
Yes.

92
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:15,560
Be careful.

93
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,120
Do you feel it when you stretch it out?

94
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:01,820
Yes.

95
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:09,820
Oh, my God.

96
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:10,350
Oh

97
01:11:54,510 --> 01:12:02,510


98
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:53,740
Oh

99
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,860
I can't do this anymore.

100
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:16,050
I can't do this anymore.

101
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:16,330
I can't do this anymore.

102
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:17,270
I can't do this anymore.

103
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:19,230
I can't do this anymore.

104
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:20,810
I can't do this anymore.

105
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:21,010
I can't do this anymore.

106
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:21,370
I can't do this anymore.

107
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:22,030
I can't do this anymore.

108
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:22,710
I can't do this anymore.

109
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:27,120
I can't do this anymore.

110
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:27,860
What do you do at that time?

111
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,220
At that time, yes.

112
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:33,980
Do you really call someone?

113
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,160
No, I don't call anyone.

114
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:38,820
Really?

115
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:39,500
Yes.

116
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,480
It's fun and lonely, isn't it?

117
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,020
I'm a little frustrated.

118
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,700
It's different after all.

119
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:50,140
Yes.

120
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,740
Drink it, drink it, drink it.

121
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,420
If you hear such a story.

122
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:04,420
When I heard it, I thought it was hot, but it was really warm.

123
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,040
I don't even know that place.

124
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:30,350
It's hot, so can I go to the side?

125
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:40,350
I'm sweating.

126
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:50,650
I can smell it.

127
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:50,870
I'm sorry.

128
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,660
You look like an adult.

129
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,100
You look like someone who likes kindness.

130
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,440
Are you really different?

131
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:08,180
I don't want to be bullied.

132
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,280
You're making a mess.

133
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,240
You should drink it.

134
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,180
Really?

135
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:32,720
I want to be beaten.

136
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,640
You want to be beaten?

137
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,340
Isn't that a line?

138
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:44,880
It's not a selfie, is it?

139
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,540
No, it's not a selfie.

140
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,260
It's funny, isn't it?

141
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,640
It's hot, isn't it?

142
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:00,830
It's hot.

143
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,670
It's hot, isn't it?

144
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:04,610
Can I roll it?

145
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:05,690
Yes.

146
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:24,600
It's so hot.

147
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:45,050
It's so hot.

148
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:47,890
You're sweating so much.

149
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:51,790
You're sweating so much.

150
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:54,450
Take it off.

151
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:55,370
Take it off, take it off, take it all off.

152
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:56,450
All of it?

153
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:12,990
Are you okay?

154
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,460
Why did you say that?

155
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,600
Are you going to bully me?

156
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,500
Do you want to be bullied?

157
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,720
Yes, I want to be bullied.

158
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,890
You've grown up.

159
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:42,730
What do you want me to do?

160
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:47,290
I want you to touch me more.

161
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:48,770
Where?

162
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:57,030
I want to ask you a question.

163
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,490
Where do you feel comfortable?

164
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:03,910
In my stomach.

165
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,310
In your stomach?

166
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:12,930
Don't you want to sleep? Do you want to drink a little more?

167
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:18,030
Are you shy?

168
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:18,130
What are you doing?

169
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:46,600
You like Sanpito, don't you?

170
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:02,170
I'm sorry.

171
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:10,550
Do you want a kiss?

172
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,680
Do you want to take a shower?

173
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:01,760
No, I don't want to.

174
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:04,850
Then you can take a shower.

175
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:06,650
It's getting late.

176
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,030
I want to take a shower.

177
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,050
It's getting late.

178
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:20,430
I want to take a shower.

179
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:32,940
I want to take a shower.

180
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:35,580
I want to take a shower.

181
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:35,820
It hurts.

182
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:28,270
I can't breathe.

183
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:30,670
I can't breathe.

184
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:44,700
Aren't you embarrassed?

185
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,040
Why am I embarrassed?

186
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:34,370
You look like your favorite dog, Yotsumba.

187
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:36,390
You look like a dog.

188
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,510
You really look like a dog.

189
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:50,410
Where are your eyes now?

190
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:53,840
I don't know.

191
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:30,090
I can't do it.

192
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:27,580


193
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:56,600
It's getting hot in here.

194
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:00,480
I'm getting excited.

195
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Can I touch you?

196
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:21,240
I don't know what to do.

197
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:33,480


198
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,800
I love you, JinJin.

199
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,020
JinJin, what's wrong?

200
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,610
I want you to rub it on my back.

201
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:44,670
You don't have to do that.

202
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:48,930
It's not enough.

203
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,950
Your hips are moving.

204
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:27,550
I'll just rub it on.

205
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:33,210
I don't want to do this anymore.

206
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:35,410
Where?

207
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:38,530
Over there.

208
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:39,330
Sonny...

209
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:43,330
I'm so sorry...

210
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:27,610
Can you look this way?

211
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:49,600
What are you doing?

212
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:37,540
Look at me.

213
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:25,390
Look at me.

214
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:33,790
Touch me.

215
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:17,580
I want a kiss.

216
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:32,160
What's wrong with you?

217
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:54,880
I don't know.

218
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:45,700
Oh, my God.

219
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:24,100
Oh, my God.

220
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:49,180
Oh, my God.

221
01:57:17,450 --> 01:57:18,030
Oh, my God.
