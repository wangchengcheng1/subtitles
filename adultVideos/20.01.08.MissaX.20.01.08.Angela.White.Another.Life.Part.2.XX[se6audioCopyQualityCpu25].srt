1
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:27,380
The film school...


00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:15,590
Today, at least this week...

3
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,630
Oh no, I can't deal with these Americans anymore.

4
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,710
I'll see you at the office.

5
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,990
I've had it up to here with these Americans.

6
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,190


7
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,930
What are you doing? You have a photoshoot today?

8
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,550
Oh, I have to check my schedule.

9
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,670
Your schedule?

10
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:09,030


11
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:19,420


12
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,220


13
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,660


14
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,240


15
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,040
been on the payroll for 15 years.

16
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,170
Oui?

17
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,220
Ah mais non!

18
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,280
On ne peut plus attendre!

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,100
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes?

20
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,920
Non!

21
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,580
Je quitte!

22
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,020
I need my phone.

23
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,520
Asshole.

24
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:23,700
So, Tommy, I've been having trouble finding the contracts.

25
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,120
We've been moving stuff around, so they may have been misplaced.

26
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,620
Oh, no worries. We'll look together.

27
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,540
You look lovely, by the way.

28
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,540
Oh, thank you.

29
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,320
You doing okay?

30
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,880
You seem a little off. Are you a little frustrated?

31
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,360
Uh, I'm just a little bit overwhelmed.

32
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,220
Well, completely out of it would be more accurate.

33
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,920
Okay, um, so let's go have a seat then.

34
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,360
Okay.

35
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,190
Would you like a water?

36
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,270
A vodka soda would be amazing.

37
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,670
If there's any vodka in this house.

38
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,710
No, because Francois believes there's gluten in it.

39
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,810
Oh, a Diet Coke then? Unless there's gluten in that too?

40
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,990
That I could do. Coming up.

41
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,830
Here you go.

42
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,270
Thank you.

43
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,010
I was just thinking about when you would order those vodka sodas.

44
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,710
You ordered so many during the New Year's Eve party our freshman year.

45
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,870
I love vodka sodas. I drink them all the time.

46
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,650


47
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,890
I always make sure my manager...

48
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,250
Whoa, wait. Joint? Manager? Who are you and what did you do with Joss?

49
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:11,450
Are you happy with how things turned out where you ended up?

50
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,900


51
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,540


52
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:37,870


53
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,470
I guess I did, too.

54
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,070
You know, I always thought I'd be an actress.

55
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,610
But who knows what I'd be missing out on here

56
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,990
if I'd gone down that route.

57
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,640
You could have done it.

58
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,240
I think out of everybody in our group,

59
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,240
I really felt you were the one that could have done it.

60
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,300
I mean, yeah, sure, everyone picked their safer thing,

61
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:17,300


62
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,880


63
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:33,700


64
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,160
the manager right before you left you said you're gonna remember my face

65
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,720


66
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,280
It was so cool.

67
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:55,290
Do you remember why I never ended up going to LA?

68
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,110
Um, yeah. It was Francois.

69
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,670
I mean, you and I planned on going to LA after we graduated.

70
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,990
and I mean we were gonna go out there together and but things were you and

71
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,220
Francois got more serious and right when your student loan was approved he

72
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:28,220


73
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,910
All three of us.

74
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,750
No.

75
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,890
His business started to get bigger

76
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,690
and he wouldn't have budged.

77
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,650
You know, honestly, I'm surprised

78
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,690
you don't remember any of this.

79
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,450
You and him almost split up because of it.

80
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,010
Oh, I see.

81
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,890
Hey, the last time you saw me,

82
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,150
did I seem happy?

83
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,690


84
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:22,730


85
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,560
Until this morning, I was living a completely different life.

86
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,680


87
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:44,080


88
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,680
was woken up by an intruder I went out to confront them and

89
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:56,680


90
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:16,960


91
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:26,710
it seems like I never really found my calling yeah you and I both I always

92
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:34,640


93
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,140
so afraid of losing you or having a chance or something with you.

94
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,020
Um, you know what? I shouldn't have said that.

95
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:05,650
From the day I met you, I knew you were different.

97
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,850
I always had a little crush on you when we were working together.

98
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:19,820


99
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:33,020


100
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:44,180


101
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:58,000


102
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000


103
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,680
do it again we both could ah come on that's crazy

104
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:18,080
crazy. Your house is here, Francois. Your whole life is here.

105
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,600


106
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,720


107
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,940
keeping me in this town. Just like all those years ago.

108
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:45,940


109
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:54,800
if you went out there but I'm pretty sure my time I missed my chance Joss

110
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,180


111
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:12,320


112
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:37,690


113
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:48,230


114
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:42,960
Is there anything? Just tell me. Just say it.

115
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I feel so familiar.

116
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,070
I got it.

117
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,520
Sorry.

118
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,580
I'm sorry.

119
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Oh, God.

120
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,370
Oh, God.

121
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,270
Oh, God.

122
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:03,660


123
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:36,870
I don't think anyone's worshipped me like this.

124
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,130
How did you know?

125
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,370
You've talked about it.

126
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,530
Of course I have.

127
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,310
after you had one or two many

128
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:53,120
so weird like i feel like i've known you for so long even though

129
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,120
Technically, I just think it's so weird.

130
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,100
I feel really good with you.

131
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,720
What if what you said changes?

132
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,520
What do you mean?

133
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,020
Say if one morning you wake up and someone else is there.

134
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,750
I would never make that decision again.

135
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,120
I want to see where this leads, you and I.

136
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,360
Like it was supposed to be.

137
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,290
This feels so right.

138
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,320
Oh

139
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:14,610
Oh

140
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,390
Oh

141
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,720
Hmm

142
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,460
Yeah.

143
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,360
Yes.

144
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,280
Oh my God, I'm sweating.

145
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,920
Yeah.

146
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,600
Yeah.

147
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Oh my God.

148
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,460
Sorry.

149
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:56,560


150
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,790
Oh my god.

151
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,800
Do you like that?

152
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,580
Yeah.

153
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:42,960
Yeah?

154
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,480
Yeah.

155
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah.

156
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,600
I can't wait to go on your body.

157
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,700
Yeah.

158
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,100
Yeah.

159
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,490
Okay.

160
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:14,990
Yeah?

161
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:15,630
Yeah.

162
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,980
Ready?

163
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,120
Ready?

164
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,320
Okay.

165
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:36,770
Yeah.

166
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:47,210


167
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:27,100


168
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,820


169
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:44,320


170
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:49,720
Mmm

171
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,130
Yeah

172
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,870
Oh, wow

173
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,160
You're a messy one aren't you?

174
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,920
Well, I haven't played with one of these for a while.

175
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:20,960
I have a Dolph Rhoad headlight on the left.

176
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,000
So it's fun.

177
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:31,900
Fuck.

178
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,610
Oh my God.

179
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:17,910
Are you putting it all in your mouth?

180
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,700
Are you trying to put it all in your mouth?

181
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm trying.

182
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,500
Let me help.

183
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,800
Oh.

184
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,820
You stayed in for a second.

185
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Oh my god it's so deep like that.

186
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:18,570


187
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:54,720


188
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:02,320


189
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,420
It's incredible.

190
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,600
Oh my god.

191
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,220
Fuck.

193
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,980
You're feeling it.

194
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,180
Oh my god.

195
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,140
Yes, yes.

196
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,850
Oh my god, yes.

197
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:05,850


198
00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:03,830


199
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:26,180


200
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:41,650


201
00:44:41,650 --> 00:45:03,360


202
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360


203
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,790


204
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:36,100


205
00:45:37,500 --> 00:46:22,000


206
00:46:46,670 --> 00:47:00,290


207
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:00,830


208
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,030


209
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,610


210
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,250


211
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,730


212
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,690
Yes, please.

213
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:08,450
You're right.

214
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,310
Don't!

215
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,420
Yes!

216
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:52,020
Oh, my God.

217
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,060
Yeah, oh, my God.

218
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:34,650
Oh

219
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:55,300
Oh

220
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:25,300


221
00:51:35,100 --> 00:52:22,970


222
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,330
I don't know, it's always weird.

223
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:38,820
I know it's gonna take forever to pack all this stuff.

224
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,590
Nope.

225
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,750
I'm only taking the essentials.

226
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:07,650
I'll put this in the closet.

227
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,380
Thank you.

228
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,520
Ah!
