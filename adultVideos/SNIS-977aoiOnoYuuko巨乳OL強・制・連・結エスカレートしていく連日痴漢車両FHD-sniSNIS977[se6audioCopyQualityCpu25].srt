1
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:34,160
Thanks for watching!

2
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:49,060
私は葵、OL3年目。広告代理店の仕事をしている。

3
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,700
プランニングの仕事を希望しているが、現実は使いっ走りな営業である。

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,680
なかなか就職しない彼氏とは3年前に縁を切った。

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,640
おかげさまでセックスはご無沙汰ではあるが、まあストレスからは解放されたから良しとする。

6
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:18,440
学生の頃は毎日が刺激的で、きっと絵日記にしたらカラフルだったんだと思う。

7
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,980
社会人になってからは1年があっという間に過ぎていく。

8
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,780
先のことを考えると少し不安になることだってある。

9
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,740
今は働いている人が多い。

10
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,780
ちょっと近い。

11
00:05:30,810 --> 00:08:13,640
This is the first time I've ever done this, so I'm excited to see how it will turn out.

12
00:08:14,420 --> 00:09:43,690
I've never done this before, so I'm excited to see how it will turn out.

13
00:09:43,690 --> 00:11:22,420
This is the first time I've ever done this, so I'm excited to see how it will turn out.

14
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,900
This is the first time I've ever done this, so I'm excited to see how it will turn out.

15
00:12:32,730 --> 00:15:45,310
This is the first time I've ever done this, so I'm excited to see how it will turn out.

16
00:15:47,770 --> 00:18:03,830
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

17
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,180
You touched it, didn't you?

18
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:30,980
What?

19
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,940
You have a bag, don't you?

20
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,240
How can I touch it?

21
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,980
But now...

22
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,580
What?

23
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,560
Hey, hey, don't bother me.

24
00:21:42,200 --> 00:27:05,460
You're so sticky.

25
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:21,820
Sticky.

26
00:34:53,590 --> 00:36:44,070
After that, I ran to the bathroom.

27
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,990
The stockings had a lot of lotion on them.

28
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,530
Did you feel it?

29
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,870
No, not at all.

30
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,570
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

31
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,070
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

32
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,970
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

33
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,990
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

34
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,050
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

35
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,790
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

36
00:37:48,030 --> 00:38:02,090
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

37
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:40,410
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

38
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,070
I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't have said it.

39
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:50,730
Why do I have to change my bike?

40
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,450
You can change it normally.

41
00:38:52,910 --> 00:39:04,040
Don't touch me.

42
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:17,670
Don't touch me.

43
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:50,340
Everyone is the same as yesterday.

44
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,200
You'll get wet soon.

45
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,840
You'll get wet soon.

46
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,560
You're wet, aren't you?

47
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,800
Don't touch me.

48
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,950
Don't touch me.

49
00:40:50,110 --> 00:41:06,310
Don't touch me.

50
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,330
Don't touch me.

51
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,600
Don't touch me.

52
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,970
Is your voice going to leak?

53
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,480
You don't like it?

54
00:45:40,120 --> 00:47:33,450
Your voice is so quiet.

55
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,120
I'm sorry.

56
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,760
I'm sorry.

57
00:48:24,760 --> 00:49:30,240
I'm sorry.

58
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,470
I'm sorry.

59
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,110
I'm sorry.

60
00:49:43,310 --> 00:50:00,820
I'm sorry.

61
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:21,360
I'm sorry.

62
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:21,800
I'm sorry.

63
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,040
I'm sorry.

64
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,560
I'm sorry.

65
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:23,980
I don't want to do that.

66
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,310
It's obvious that you don't want to do either.

67
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:32,990
Shut up.

68
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,130
Move it.

69
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:41,160
If you want to do it, do it.

70
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,400
Do it.

71
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:58,180
Move it.

72
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,260
But...

73
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,090
Don't stop.

74
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:46,030
Don't stop.

75
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:47,850
I won't move it.

76
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,090
I won't let you get away with it.

77
00:52:42,360 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm going to take a different train tomorrow.

78
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,280
It's too late. Give up.

79
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,420
Give up.

80
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,580
I'm going to get out of here.

81
00:54:26,660 --> 00:56:24,730
It's over. It's over.

82
00:59:21,580 --> 01:01:50,970
I don't know what to do.

83
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,740
It's starting to break down somewhere.

84
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,440
When I'm with my boyfriend who likes to decorate,

85
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,720
I can't get used to my daily life.

86
01:06:04,360 --> 01:09:01,350
Is this okay?

87
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:52,320
It doesn't work at all.

88
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:29,500
It's not like that.

89
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,140
It's so big.

90
01:15:31,640 --> 01:17:09,170
I don't want to do that.

91
01:18:14,580 --> 01:19:25,620
I can't do it.

92
01:19:28,740 --> 01:21:25,690
Do it by yourself.

93
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:40,460
Do it by yourself.

94
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:52,760
What are you doing?

95
01:21:52,980 --> 01:22:01,570
Are you messing with me?

96
01:22:32,530 --> 01:23:41,090
What are you going to do?

97
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,340
Are you going to quit?

98
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,280
You don't want to, do you?

99
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,820
I don't want to, but...

100
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:59,520
If you're going to quit, then do it.

101
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:15,510
You're going to quit, right?

102
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:25,300
You're going to sleep, aren't you?

103
01:31:17,830 --> 01:34:54,540
You're going to move normally, aren't you?

104
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:46,010
I don't want to do this anymore.

105
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:49,630
I don't want to do this anymore.

106
01:37:50,330 --> 01:38:43,980
I don't want to do this anymore.

107
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:48,400
I don't want to do this anymore.

108
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:49,500
I can't take it anymore.

109
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,600
I can't take it anymore.

110
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:27,680
Are you okay?

111
01:42:29,040 --> 01:43:12,850
The sound from yesterday was terrible.

112
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:13,050
It's the other way around.

113
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:16,690
They let me do the flatulence and just let me get in.

114
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:18,910
They tried to test me.

115
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:21,590
There's nothing I want to do.

116
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:25,090
But I moved my hips.

117
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:28,070
Even though I'm a stranger.

118
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:51,220
Even though he's a nice guy.

119
02:03:18,600 --> 02:04:14,600
I can't do this anymore.

120
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:17,120
It feels weird.

121
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:18,660
I feel weird.

122
02:04:23,090 --> 02:08:01,530
I feel weird.

123
02:08:27,930 --> 02:08:29,130
I'll see you in a bit.

124
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:32,130
I'll see you in a bit.

125
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:32,610
I'll see you in a bit.

126
02:09:13,100 --> 02:14:32,980
I'll see you in a bit.

127
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:14,240
I might have wanted to live like this all my life.

128
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:17,380
Let's go shopping on the day after tomorrow.

129
02:18:18,550 --> 02:18:20,280
I'm going to buy a mini skirt.
