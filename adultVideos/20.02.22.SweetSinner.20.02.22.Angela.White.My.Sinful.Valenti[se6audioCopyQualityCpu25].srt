1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,140
Charlie had spent the last year trying to prove that he didn't want love


00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,420
or that love didn't exist.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,180
And in the process, he'd hurt a lot of people, including himself.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,040
But it was time for him to change that.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,800
After thoroughly reviewing a few algorithms,

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,700
he realized that the best possible match for Elaine

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,400
was actually a pastor from a neighboring church.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,940
church. He knew about Elaine's past with Jamie, and he loved her anyway.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,940


10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,660


11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,280
other people find true love deserved to find it herself.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,360


13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,240
Do you have anything special planned?

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,560
Other than drinking a bottle of wine and watching bad rom-coms?

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,120
No. You?

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,280
I actually have dinner reservations.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,980
Oh, how lovely! Who's the lucky girl?

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,240
Well, I thought it would be you.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,640
Me?

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,700


21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,120
but I never had courage to do so until now.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,030
I... I don't think...

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,410
That's okay, I understand.

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:28,110
No, I was going to say, I don't think that was a question.

25
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:36,990


26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,350
Hillary, would you?

27
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:38,650
Yes.

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,850


29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,830
and turned out to be part of the 80% success rate.

30
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,770
I can't even remember the last time I brought somebody back to my place.

31
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,030
Well, then I consider myself lucky.

32
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:16,110
You kiss so well.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,600
Me too.

34
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,200
I never thought we'd be doing this.

35
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,260
Me too.

36
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,980
I like you.

37
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,460
I like you more.

38
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,540
Let me get you up.

39
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,240
It's been a while.

40
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,740
I can help you.

41
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,640
Help me?

42
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,070
I've always wondered what's under here.

43
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,900
Come on, this feels so good

44
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,230
You're so giving

45
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,120
Hmm

46
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,410
Yes.

47
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,760
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

48
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,330
Oh, fuck.

49
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I love that you're so good at this.

50
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:45,580
I don't want you to do it like that

51
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,680
as you feel the throbbing heart in your mouth

52
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,560
and then you're talking

53
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,880
tease me first

54
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,370
Oh, my God.

55
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,620
Oh

56
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:17,090
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

57
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,920
Suck.

58
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,480
Yes.

59
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,060
Yeah.

60
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,060
Yeah.

61
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,350
Yes, please.

62
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:37,560
I don't want to say it again.

63
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,070
Yeah.

64
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,940
Yeah.

65
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,780
Yes.

66
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,660
Oh.

67
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,680
God, you feel so fucking gross.

68
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,610
Suck.

69
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,630
Mm, fuck.

70
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,160
Yes, please.

71
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Please.

72
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,700
Oh

73
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Oh

74
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,060
Oh, fuck.

75
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,440
Oh, fuck.

76
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,610
Oh, fuck.

77
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,580
Oh, fuck.

78
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,880
Yes, yes, yes.

79
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,120
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:19,240
Oh, oh.

83
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,120
Oh, yeah.

84
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,640
Oh, yeah.

85
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,600
Oh, yeah.

86
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,680
Shh.

87
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,730
You're so good.

88
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,020
You're amazing.

89
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,200
Happy Valentine's Day.

90
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,020
Happy Valentine's Day.

91
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:17,160
I told you a flower delivery business wasn't for you.

92
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,100
What are you talking about?

93
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,980
It's one o'clock.

94
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,920
The day's not even halfway done and you're already home.

95
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,340
Well, I had to deliver these.

96
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,820
Wow, this guy never misses a beat.

97
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,420
Birthday, New Year's Eve plans, Valentine's Day.

98
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,940
Why do you sound so annoyed?

99
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,520


100
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,660
Does that sound horrible?

101
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,920
No, not really.

102
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,300
I guess it just feels like he's just going through the motions.

103
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,880
I want somebody who does something because their heart's in it.

104
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,330
I left Kyle's bouquet in the car because...

105
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,790
Well, I hate that fucking prick.

106
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,210
You got me flowers?

107
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,190
Look, I've been awful the last few years.

108
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,350
And not just to the people at work, but to you.

109
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,250
Well, you were awful when we dated.

110
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,090
I wanted a chance.

111
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:36,890
What?

112
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,030
Look, I know you're a match with someone else.

113
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,430
but maybe we could be the non-match that somehow...

114
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:42,910
Still works out?

115
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:43,890
Yeah.

116
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,430
And when we were together, I was scared of everything.

117
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,470
But I'm not anymore.

118
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,910
And maybe it's too late to say this.

119
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,210
It's not.

120
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,130
I love you.

121
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,450
Finally, you fucking figured that out.

122
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,610
The moral to this story

123
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,330
is whether algorithms say you're a perfect match

124
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,030
or whether you don't seem like a match at all,

125
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,290
love will always find you when you're ready for it.

126
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,130
Happy Valentine's Day.
