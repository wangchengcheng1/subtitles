00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,380
Hey Emily, what are you doing?


00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,340
Thank you for inviting me.

3
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,440
But I want to quit this time.

4
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm like a zombie.

5
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,860
I haven't been able to sleep properly for a month.

6
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,740
Thank you.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Hey Emily, what are you doing?

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,900
You know, right?

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,320
Do you remember?

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,820
About the dream.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,020
It will never disappear.

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,460
That dream you had with your Egyptian wife?

13
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,940
Kiki...

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,620
It's been like this for a few weeks.

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,180


16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,320
Of course, I did everything I could.

17
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,880
I went to the doctor and went to therapy.

18
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,280
I tried all the martial arts, but it didn't work at all.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
It doesn't make any sense at all.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,060
I don't know what to do.

21
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,690
Hey, I don't have a way to introduce her to you.

22
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,190
She is the last...

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,640
Really? I'll do anything.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,340
Will you tell me about her?

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,940
Yes, she is a very good person.

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,080
I think she can help you.

27
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,550
Yeah, and then?

28
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,170
And then?

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,250
Is this it?

30
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,090
Your phone number is 06-39-715-4532.

31
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,830
This is your phone number.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,650
Are you okay?

33
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,090
Okay.

34
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,410
That's all?

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,730
Okay.

36
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,710
I'll call this person right away.

37
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,030
Thank you.

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:03:11,620
That's a nice dress.

39
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,400
This is Emily.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,260
Please come in.

41
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:30,210
So, Emily, what did you do today?

42
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,290
What can I do for you?

43
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,050
I've been having a weird dream for the past few weeks.

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,510
It's like I'm the queen of Egypt, the queen of Egypt.

45
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,550
And I have a dream of becoming the king of Egypt.

46
00:03:50,550 --> 00:04:02,830


47
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:11,420
That dream is very intense.

48
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,450
I've been having that dream every day for the past few weeks.

49
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:51,430


50
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,190


51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,130
I understand.

52
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,230
You seem to be trapped in your previous life.

53
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,230
What? Am I the queen of Egypt?

54
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,130
Do you want to break up with your husband?

55
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,270
Do you want to break up with your husband?

56
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,530
My husband?

57
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,730
I'm not married yet.

58
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,910
Emily, if you want to be released,

59
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,510
you have to believe me.

60
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,410
My husband...

61
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,270
I want to talk to him.

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,840
That's how you do it.

63
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,270
What are you doing?

64
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Ouch!

65
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,280
Hey, don't tease me!

66
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,110
Emily, I finally found you.

67
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:19,080
Stop it. This is not funny.

68
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,940
This is not a dream.

69
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,920
We can be together again.

70
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:36,950
Let's rewrite our memories forever.

71
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,050
I...

72
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,250
I'm really sorry for making you wait so long.

73
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,140
I'm sorry.

74
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:47,640
Oh

75
00:15:09,180 --> 00:16:45,820


76
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,980
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

77
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:29,880
I want you to love me more.

78
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,080
I want you to love me more.
