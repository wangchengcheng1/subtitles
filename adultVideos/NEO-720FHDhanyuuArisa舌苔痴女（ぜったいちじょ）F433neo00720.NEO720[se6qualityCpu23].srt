I don't know what to do.

4
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,460
I don't know what to do.

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:13,080
I don't know what to do.

6
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,660
I don't know what to do.

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,240
I don't know what to do.

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
I don't know what to do.

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,580
I don't know what to do.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,760
I don't know what to do.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,440
I don't know what to do.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,840
I don't know what to do.

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,180
I don't know.

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,560
I don't know what to do.

15
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,340
It feels so good.

16
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,780
I love kissing.

17
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,970
What were you looking at?

18
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,830
Do you want to kiss me?

19
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,750
That's why you've been looking at me for a long time.

20
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,670
I want to kiss someone like you instead of doing it myself.

21
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,330
Do you want to kiss Arisa?

22
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,650
What should I do?

23
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,100
It's dirty.

24
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,660
Did you think you could kiss me?

25
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,060
Did you think you could kiss me?

26
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,720
There's no way I could do that with you.

27
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,300
Why do I have to kiss you?

28
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
It's disgusting.

29
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,480
There's no way I can kiss you, right?

30
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,500
You don't have it, do you?

31
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,700
You're just right if you're dirty with my dandruff.

32
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,980
What do you think?

33
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,380
What's with that face?

34
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,540
Are you sad?

35
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,120
You're not really sad, are you?

36
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,620
You've been so excited to see my dandruff.

37
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,820
It feels so bad.

38
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,310
I love you so much.

39
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,970

I love you so much.

51
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,630
I love you.

52
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:49,630

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,550

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,730
Hora.

Ah, kitanai.

60
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,330
Wow, your face is very salty.

61
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,490
I have to disinfect it.

62
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,710
Come on, disinfect.

63
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,950
I'll disinfect you with my saliva.

64
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,090
Wow, it's still salty.

65
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,570
How much sweat are you sweating?

66
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,250
Come on.

67
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,550
How is it? My saliva.

68
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:15,550

I love you so much.

83
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,010
I love you so much.

84
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,830
I love you so much.

85
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,440
I love you so much.

86
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,180

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,390
Because it's so disgusting.

97
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,710
Really.

98
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,650
Hey, what do you want me to do?

99
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,310
Maybe it's more sticky and smelly.

100
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,910
I want you to put on dirty clothes.

101
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,190
Do you want me to put on dirty clothes?

102
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,890
You're such a pervert.

103
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,170
It still feels so bad.

104
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,470
What are you looking at?

105
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,740
Amazing.

106
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,730
It's so messy.

107
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,760
For your sake,

108
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,900
For the sake of you, I gave you my wings.

109
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,440
For the sake of you, who are so disgusting.

110
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

111
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,140
I wanted to put a lot of it on your face.

112
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,090
It's so sticky.

113
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,170
Your face is so sticky.

114
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:57,990
I'm getting so sticky.

115
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,690
Aren't you embarrassed?

116
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,850
You're so sticky.

117
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,010
You're spitting on a girl.

118
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:21,590
Hey, you're so smelly.

119
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,580


120
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,900
My leber leber matuba

121
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,320
Do you really want it that much?

122
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:39,410
Do you like it so much?

123
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,170
Do you like it so much?

124
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,910
You look like you want it so much that you can't stop.

125
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,900
You look like you want it so much that you can't stop.

126
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:03,900
I'll put a lot on your face.

127
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,520
You like it, don't you?

128
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,880
It's in my mouth all the time.

129
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm about to laugh.

130
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,600
Should I put all this on your face?

131
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,660


132
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,450
If you like it, you'll be happy, right?

133
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:36,160


134
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:36,420


135
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,480
It's time to take a bath.

136
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,780
It's so hot.

137
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,180
It's so cute.

138
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,260
Does it feel good?

139
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,560
Why?

140
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:51,380
Can I smell it?

141
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:57,870
Do you want to smell it?

142
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,250
I don't like it

143
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,850
What do you want to smell?

144
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,210
Just a little

145
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,550
It's okay if it's just a little bit.

146
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:21,610
What do you smell like?

147
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,010
I don't smell anything.

148
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,470
You don't smell anything? Really?

149
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,290
It's the first time I've seen you like that.

150
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,040
Is it cute?

151
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,070
Do you like my nose?

152
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,590
Have you ever seen this?

153
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,410
What?

154
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,530
Your tongue is a tool to make your tongue clean.

155
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,270
What?

156
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,070
Is that so?

157
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,810


158
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,770
Yes, it will be cleaner.

159
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,810
How do I do it?

160
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,750
Put your tongue out like this.

161
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,010
Hold this.

162
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Wait, let me take it out and pull it out from the top like this.

163
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Did you clean it up?

164
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,490
Please do it again.

165
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:47,760
It's all over the place.

166
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,680
But it doesn't smell that bad.

167
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:58,980
I don't think it's dirty.

168
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:10,490
It's not dirty.

169
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,760
It's not dirty.

170
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,040
It wasn't that dirty.

171
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:17,920
Really?

172
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,480
Then maybe it was clean.

173
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,360
Maybe so.

174
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,940
Can I try it one more time?

175
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,580
Yes.

176
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,980
Wow.

177
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:48,100
One more time?

178
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:49,990
Yes.

179
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,370
I don't like it.

180
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:59,430
I don't like it.

181
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,880
I love your dirty tongue, so I'll have some yogurt.

182
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,220
Did you bring yogurt?

183
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,640
That's a lot of energy.

184
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Did you get dirty?

185
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,170
Oh, that's good.

186
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,170
Really?

187
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,000
That's amazing.

188
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,160
Is it delicious?

189
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm sorry, there's a lot of dirt on the floor.

190
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,100
I'm sorry.

191
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,770
I'll clean it up.

192
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,600
There's still a lot left.

193
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,780
I got a lot of dirt.

194
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,540
Did you eat?

195
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,500
I'm so happy to be able to take a video like this.

196
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,190
I'm so happy to be able to take a video like this.

I'm so happy to be able to take a video like this.

200
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:01,860
I'm so happy to be able to take a video like this.

201
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:32,420
I think it feels good to lick your face.

202
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,510
Do you want me to lick your face?

203
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,970
Do you want me to lick you?

204
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:55,930
Do you like it?

205
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:16,070
Do you want me to lick your face?

206
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,740
Do you want me to lick your face?

207
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Wow, it's amazing that my licking makes your face shiny.

208
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:11,150


209
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,620
I'll stretch it out for you, okay?

210
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,670
I'll stretch it out for you, okay?

211
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,590
I'll stretch it out for you, okay?

00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,150
I'll stretch it out for you, okay?

214
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,680
It's so good to see your bright face.

215
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,740
How do you feel?

216
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,580
I'm so happy.

217
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,320
Really?

218
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm so happy.

219
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,720
I'm so happy.

220
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,100
I'm so happy.

221
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,760
I'm so happy.

222
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,690
I'm so happy.

223
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:45,950
I'm so happy.

224
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,550
I can't breathe.

225
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,570
It's so bad.

226
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,620
I can smell someone's urine.

227
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,470
I can smell someone's urine.

228
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Hey, you liked yogurt, didn't you?

229
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,250
Yes.

230
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,610
Aji hensutei?

231
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,950

Aji hensutei?

249
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,720
Aji hensutei?

250
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,400
It feels so good, isn't it?

251
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,320
It's amazing.

252
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,280
It's delicious.

253
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,110
I spilled it.

254
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:19,230
It's all gone.

255
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,610
I'll put it all on for you.

256
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,180
Your face is so shiny.

257
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,060
My armpits are shiny.

258
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,320
It smells so good.

259
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,260
I'm going to dry it and coat it for you.

260
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,590
Wow, amazing!

261
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,630
It's getting drier and drier.

262
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,030
Wow, amazing!

263
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,150
I might not be able to smell it anymore.

264
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,350
Wow, amazing!

265
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:41,290
Ippai, ippai, ippai, ippai, ippai, ippai, ippai, ippai.

266
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:02,860


267
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,650
Are you okay?

268
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:49,920
Let's get rid of this part too.

269
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,330
Let's get rid of it.

270
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,150
It hurts a lot.

271
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,890
Wait a minute.

272
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:14,420
Wait a minute.

273
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,860
It hurts so much.

274
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,640
Let's get rid of this part too.

275
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,100
It hurts a lot.

276
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,320
Oh, you're standing up so high.

277
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,790
I'm standing up so high, too.

278
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:02,450
This is amazing.

279
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,030
Open your mouth.

280
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:12,360
I'll stretch it out for you.

281
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,920
You like it, don't you?

282
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja.

283
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:12,020


284
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:43,580


285
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,140
I love drooling and

286
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,280
It's so good!

287
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,320
It's amazing!

288
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,560
I want to eat more and more

289
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,680
It's all over my face

290
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,620
My favorite tooth

291
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,940
I have a lot of teeth

292
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,180
It's all over my face

293
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,700
I don't want to eat it anymore.

294
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:10,480
It's all over the place.

295
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,780
It's all over the place.

296
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,720
It's all over the place.

297
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,080
There's a lot of it.

298
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,080
Look at this.

299
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,900
You are a great boy, aren't you?

300
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:01,520
I wonder if you like this kind of thing too.

301
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,620
Because you like to be chubby, don't you?

302
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Oh, you peed on your butt.

303
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,740
I wonder if you can still come out.

304
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,520
I'm going to clean it up for you.

305
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,320
I put it in your mouth.

306
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,760
I'm going to clean it up for you.

307
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,460
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

308
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,280
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

309
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,820
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

310
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,260
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

311
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,240
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

312
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,480
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

313
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,370
I'm going to put it in your buttocks.

314
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,970
もう洗わないで帰ってね。

315
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,440
私、氷アイス大好きなの。

316
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,800
あなたも好き?

317
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,780
美味しいよね。

318
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:47,960
でも、これだけじゃ足りなくて、もっと青い方が好きなんだ。

319
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,760
だから、いっぱい青くしちゃおうかな。

320
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,860
But it might turn blue.

321
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,080
What should I do?

322
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,460
But I like blue, so I'll put a lot of it on.

323
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:10,730
Wow!

324
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,890
Did you get a blue one?

325
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:26,190
Isn't the blue one cute?

326
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,100
Look!

327
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,080
Smite, smite, Aino.

328
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,260
Oishiii.

329
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,260
Akiyoi oishikunatta yo.

330
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,090
Aino oishii.

331
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,130
Ui, stawakunatta?

00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,110
Uihou ga kawaii yone.

333
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,280
Akiyokunatta?

334
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:25,280
Is it blue now?

335
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:58,110
Isn't the blue one cute?

336
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:21,960
It's delicious.

337
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:41,110
But it's my favorite tea.

338
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,810
I don't want it to get dirty.

339
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,550
Can I take it off?

340
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:12,800
It's so cute, isn't it?

341
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:21,520
The inside is so cute, isn't it?

342
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,840
Do you want to see it?

343
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:38,860
It's important, so keep it.

344
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:51,300
Is it cute?

345
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,060
What does it taste like?

346
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:08,320
I don't want to eat it.

347
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,100
It's okay.

348
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,090
What does it taste like?

349
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,990
It's sweet.

350
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:25,690
Sweet?

351
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:55,930
I want you to lick it in various places.

352
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,120
In various places?

353
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,840
Like your fingers.

354
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,860
It's okay.

355
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:36,020
Does your tongue feel good?

356
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:04,160
I want you to lick more here.

357
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,510
Then, put your feet out.

358
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,270
Put your feet out here.

359
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,570
Oh, my feet?

360
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:15,730
Yes.

361
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,660
I'll lick your feet too.

362
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,460
I'll lick you with this long bed.

363
00:57:52,560 --> 00:58:00,560
Is it hot?

364
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,740
Is it nice? Do you want me to tickle you?

365
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,860
It feels good.

366
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:41,320
It's okay, it's okay.

367
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:10,330
It's fun, isn't it?

368
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,660
I'm going to take a shower.

369
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:31,200
I'm going to take a shower.

370
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm going to take a shower.

371
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,840
I'm going to take a shower.

372
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,440

01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I don't know how to put it on my head, but I don't know how to do it.

559
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:08,470
I'm sorry.

560
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:11,650
I'm sorry.

561
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:27,500
Do you feel better?

562
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:39,090
Do you feel better?

563
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:39,210
Do you want to sleep?

564
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:41,110
I want to sleep.

565
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:42,330
How about you?

566
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,400
What do you want to do?

567
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:50,940
I always wanted to sleep.

568
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:52,680
I want to sleep.

569
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,200
I want to sleep.

570
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,340
I want to sleep.

571
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:03,920
It feels so good.

572
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:49,910


573
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:39,860
I don't want to do it.

574
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:51,530
I'll put it on you this time.

575
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,320
Okay.

576
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,840
Open your legs.

577
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:19,580
It's beautiful, isn't it?

578
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:19,800
Yes.

579
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:25,780
I'm sorry.

580
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:32,790
I'm sorry.

581
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:38,460
Don't stop.

582
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:40,640
Don't stop.

583
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:48,960
It hurts.

584
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:36,930
I'm sorry.

585
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:58,240
I'm sorry.

586
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,620
I'm sorry.

587
01:56:59,620 --> 01:56:59,940
I can't breathe

588
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:07,940
I can't breathe

589
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:42,820
I can't breathe

590
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:55,350
I can't breathe

591
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:59,090
I can't breathe

592
01:57:59,090 --> 01:58:01,710
I can't breathe

593
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:18,420


594
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,260
Ah, it feels good.

595
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:23,640
Ah, it feels good.

596
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:50,410
I feel like I'm going to die.

597
02:02:51,090 --> 02:02:52,210
I feel like I'm going to die.

598
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,080
I feel like I'm going to die.

599
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:06,970
I feel like I'm going to die.

600
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:10,590
I feel like I'm going to die.

601
02:03:10,650 --> 02:03:12,390
I feel like I'm going to die.

602
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:13,470
I feel like I'm going to die.

603
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:15,610
I feel like I'm going to die.

604
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:16,870
I feel like I'm going to die.

605
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:22,150
I feel like I'm going to die.

606
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:25,090
I feel like I'm going to die.

607
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:36,070


608
02:05:03,490 --> 02:05:04,530
気持ちいい、かわいい。

609
02:05:04,910 --> 02:05:06,550
気持ちいいよ。

610
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:09,210
ちょっと気持ちいい。

611
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:10,590
いっちゃう。

612
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,710
いく、いく。

613
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:14,350
いく?

614
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:16,450
いっちゃう。

615
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:17,590
いく、いく。

616
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:25,010
ちょっとね。

617
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,440
気持ちいい。

618
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:41,660
気持ちいい。

619
02:05:58,700 --> 02:06:00,340
全部気持ちいい。

620
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:02,240
I can feel it in my body.

621
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:12,700
I love you, Sushi.

622
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,100
What?

623
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,320
I love you, Sushi.

624
02:06:22,830 --> 02:06:24,070
One more time.

625
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:27,350
I love you, Sushi.

626
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:29,960
Please.

627
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:39,330
I love you, Sushi.

628
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:43,590
Which eye do you want?

629
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:51,590
I don't know what to do.
