00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,010



00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,830
I check my rearview mirror, and there's a golf cart and some guy.

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,050
I'm furious at this point.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,350
I'm ready to give some gaffer a piece of my mind.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,730
So I jump out and stomp towards him, and who is it?

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,730
Alex Baldwin.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,930
Oh my god.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,890
Can you believe that?

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,130
Needless to say, he was speechless.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,610
He'd been texting his dog sitter and just hadn't been paying attention.

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,850
But he was so sweet and apologetic about the whole thing.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,930
Well, I would have hoped he would have been.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,330
He was only working alongside the lead of the movie for six months.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,750
I'm surprised he didn't bow down and beg for mercy.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,290


16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,070
Wait, okay, tell me you took him up on that offer.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:11,070
I told him that if we win Best Picture this year, I'll think about it.

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,070


19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,190
No, stop. He did send flowers the next day though.

20
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,770
You never told me that.

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,790
Oh honey, it was nothing. Just a friendly gesture between co-stars.

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,530
If you insist.

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,490
But if he wants to take you out, he has to go through me first.

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,790
But really, I cannot believe these stories. They're so crazy.

25
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:53,990


26
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,430
Yeah, I am unbelievably envious.

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,930
Mm-hmm. Same here.

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,550
I can't believe that you almost gave up and went back home

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,250
before you'd signed with an agency, too.

30
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,830
And before you met me.

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,450
Oh, I cannot believe it. It would have been such a waste.

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,830
Yeah.

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,630
A waste?

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,570
Oh, Jocelyn, no, not a waste like that.

35
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,270
You know what I mean, okay?

36
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,270
Okay, you would have been forced to be normal.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,250
And you said it yourself,

38
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,350
no one from your hometown ever leaves.

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,910
They just stay there.

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,910
You're right.

41
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,290
You're right, I'd be in the suburbs changing diapers

42
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,070
and dragging myself to kids' soccer matches.

43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,870
Don't forget weekend trips to Safeco Supermarket

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,310
and Catfish Roundup.

45
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,230
You're right, you're right.

46
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,890
Goddamn vultures.

47
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,250
Is that surprising?

48
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,590
The consequences of fame.

49
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:15,370


50
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,670
Now, where were we?

51
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,650
It's so good to see you.

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,950
It's so good to see you.

53
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,010
We'll see you next week.

54
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,350
Drive safely.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,070
We'll drive.

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:38,870
Okay.

57
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,270
Bye!

58
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:40,890
Bye!

59
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,650
Oh!

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,990
Someone's feeling playful.

61
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,970
Oh, it was so torturous waiting for them to leave.

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,550
I just want you all to myself.

63
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,030
You can have me.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,740
Jocelyn, are you gearing up for award season?

65
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,920
Jocelyn, come on, come on and talk to us.

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,020
Miss Blue, how was the catwalk in Berlin?

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,810
Just for the record, I'm glad you decided to stay.

68
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:00,470
I would have never met such a brilliant, exceptional, beautiful woman.

69
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,310
And I know we had a small hiccup last year, but...

70
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,830
That hiccup... you mean the affair?

71
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,930


72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,020
I'm just saying, I think it made us stronger, and...

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,320
I just...

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
I don't know what I'd do without you in my life.

75
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,380
I love you.

76
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,160
I love you too.

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,380
I love these

78
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,580
Gorgeous

79
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,760
You're so handsome

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,340
Excuse me, let's get this right

81
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,500
You're fast

82
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,140
you look so beautiful tonight

83
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,180
you just love your eyes

84
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,420
everything

85
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:32,520
take these off

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
comfortable

87
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:19,680


88
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,260
Oh my god.

89
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,670
I'm so proud of you.

90
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,530
How did I get so lucky?

91
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,430
We love you.

92
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:23,260


93
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,140
I don't know.

94
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:38,750


95
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:56,430


96
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:07,390


97
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:47,440


98
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,010
Oh, you're such a devious god.

99
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,310
Don't act like you don't love me.

100
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,950
I do, I love you.

101
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,270
You're just too good at it.

102
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,670
I like to drive you crazy.

103
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,850
You do a fantastic job.

104
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,380
You planned this.

105
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,420
I would never.

106
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,460
Then why are you wearing this lingerie?

107
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,500
I just might wear it around my house once.

108
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,200
Sure.

109
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,600
I don't know.

110
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,260
I don't know.

111
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,340
I don't know.

112
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,660
How do they resist?

113
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,900
Now I'm going to keep teasing you.

114
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,820
No.

115
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Is it mine?

116
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
It is on your eyes.

117
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,720
You promise this time?

118
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,860
I promise.

119
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:26,180
I went to the moon completely, and the moon is just you.

120
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Oh, my God.

121
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:03,360
God, I love watching you cry.

122
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
Oh, man, it's so wrong that you can make me do that.

123
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,430
God, what is this?

124
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,230
It's so beautiful

125
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,930
You're going to tease me right back huh, I guess I deserve it.

126
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:14,510
I don't want to do this.

127
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,190
Yeah.

128
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,430
Yeah.

129
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,190
Yeah.

130
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,660
Yeah.

131
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,110
Yeah.

132
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,500
Yeah.

133
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,160
Yeah.

134
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,780
Yeah.

135
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,520
Yeah.

136
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,500
Yeah.

137
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,120
Yeah.

138
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:07,970
Oh my god, your lips.

139
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh my god.

140
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,180
Oh my god, you're so good.

141
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,560
Yes

142
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,900
Oh

143
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,510
Oh, my God.

144
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,240
Oh, my God.

145
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:13,040


146
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,940
I want to feel all of your skin.

147
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,900
I'm a little smothered in here.

148
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm smothered in here.

149
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm smothered in here.

150
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm smothered in here.

151
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm smothered in here.

152
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm smothered in here.

153
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm smothered in here.

154
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,870
I'm smothered in here.

155
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,350
I'm smothered in here.

156
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:10,990
I'm smothered in here.

157
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,940
I'm smothered in here.

158
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,160
I'm smothered in here.

159
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,130
I'm smothered in here.

160
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,730
I love you all the time.

161
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:06,670
I swear your hands are magical.

162
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:31,000
I love your skin.

163
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,580
I love it when you talk like that.

164
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,950
God, you smell so good.

165
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,540
Oh my God, your body is so good.

166
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,050
Oh my God.

167
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,440
Oh my God.

168
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:24,800


169
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,520
I feel like I need to use my body.

170
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,940
I feel like I need to use my body.

171
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,100
I feel like I need to use my body.

172
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,340
I feel like I need to use my body.

173
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,980
I feel like I need to use my body.

174
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,540
I feel like I need to use my body.

175
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,680
I feel like I need to use my body.

176
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,740
I feel like I need to use my body.

177
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,260
I feel like I need to use my body.

178
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,520
Oh, man.

179
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,790
Look at me.

180
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,530
I'm so lucky.

181
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:33,080
Yes, yes.

182
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,160
So close.

183
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,700
So close.

184
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,970
I swear you are pure bliss.

185
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:39,970
I don't know what to do with you.

186
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,130
What?

187
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,410
What?

188
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,950
Oh, just that you're the sexiest woman I've ever seen.

189
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,870
Shut up.

190
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,010
That's not true.

191
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,430
You are.

192
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,070
I'm not that superstar.

193
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,700
I like you.

194
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm so lucky.

195
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,300
I love you.

196
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:00,270
Hello? How did you get in here? Who are you?

197
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,360
Hello, Jocelyn.

198
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,340
What is this? What's going on? Who are you?

199
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,620


200
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:30,260


201
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:39,340


202
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:51,030


203
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,690
where you would be now, if you had stayed.

204
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,470
None of that matters anymore.

205
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,530
It's in the past, I can't change any of it.

206
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,970
I am where I am, that's that.

207
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,630
But what if it wasn't?

208
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,790
What if I told you?

209
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,620
Give you the power of choice?

210
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,960
Don't you miss your family, Jocelyn?

211
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,260
You haven't spoken to your parents since the day you left.

212
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,260
They're getting so old.

213
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,420
But I could give you that time back.

214
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,460
What if I go back and I'm still miserable?

215
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,880
Can I come back?

216
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,360
You're looking a gift horse in the mouth.

217
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,000
I am offering you an opportunity that many people would kill for.

218
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:06,040


219
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:13,560


220
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,140
you'll start your new life

221
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,230
Baby, come back to bed

222
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,050
I'm coming
