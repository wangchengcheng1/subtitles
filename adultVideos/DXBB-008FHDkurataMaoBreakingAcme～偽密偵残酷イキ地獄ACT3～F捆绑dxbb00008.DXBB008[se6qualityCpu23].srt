1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:10,910
Thank you very much.

2
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,490
Thank you for your hard work.

3
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,430
It's been a while since I came back to Tokyo today, but you're the only one here, aren't you?

4
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,450
Yes, that's right.

5
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,870
It seems that everyone went up first.

6
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,830
That's right. I haven't heard your name yet.

7
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,510
I haven't heard of it yet.

8
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,030
I recently joined the company.

9
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,270
My name is Kurata Keiri.

10
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,890
I'm sorry I didn't notice it earlier.

11
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,630
It's okay, I don't care.

12
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,410
By the way, the chief of staff said that a new Keiri child would join.

13
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,930
It doesn't look like a countryside like everyone says.

14
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,240
It's great to be still working until this time.

15
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,200
You're excellent at talking.

16
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,620
How is it?

17
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,200
Do you want to go out for a meal?

18
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,280
I still have a lot to do.

19
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,560
Just a few words.

20
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,800
That's too bad.

21
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,820
I'll go get something to eat.

22
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,100
Hello.

23
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,800
There's a cute mouse in the office.

24
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,140
I called to ask for a little help.

25
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
I called you because I wanted you to stand up for me.

26
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,880
I'll be ready, so please take care of me.

27
00:05:20,380 --> 00:06:11,200
Please wake up, cute mouse.

28
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,780
Hey.

29
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:27,010
What is this?

30
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,030
I'll sue you for sex.

31
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,970
You'll sue me?

32
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,850
Please.

33
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,420
Please untie me quickly.

34
00:06:46,200 --> 00:07:02,150
I just want to know who you are and why you are doing this.

35
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,910
What are you talking about?

36
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,770
You are a stubborn woman.

37
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,660
I don't want to hurt you.

38
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:30,680
You just need to tell me who you are.

39
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,040
All you have to do is look at it.

40
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,090
You don't have to be stupid.

41
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,760
You were looking at the management budget with a password that only I knew.

42
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,230
That was before the settlement, so I was just checking the information.

43
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,310
So that's fine.

44
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,970
It's not a lie.

45
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,430
I'm the only one who can see that.

46
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,150
I'm the only one who can do it.

47
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,120
You opened your own computer.

48
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,780
What does that mean?

49
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,200
It's a misunderstanding.

50
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,180
Misunderstanding?

51
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,340
I'm the one who misunderstood.

52
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
Kei.

53
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,980
Stop it.

54
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,160
Who asked you to do it?

55
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,860
Who's the spy?

56
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,760
Spy?

57
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,300
I'm just Keiri.

58
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,680
Please stop.

59
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,430
Why were you looking at me?

60
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,930
Who are you?

61
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,050
Tell me!

62
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,910
Tell me!

63
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,970
You're hurting me.

64
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:09,060
I don't want to hurt you.

65
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:16,420
You're burning me up.

66
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,160
Who's the spy?

67
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,620
I'm not a spy.

68
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:24,720
It's not a Y.

69
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:39,660
Please let me go.

70
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,640
You're really strong, aren't you?

71
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,540
As expected of Spider-Man.

72
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,740
That's how you were educated, right?

73
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
You're not going to tell me

74
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,340
even if you're being treated like this, are you?

75
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,780
Hmm?

76
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,320
What are you going to do?

77
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,120
Let's get started.

78
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,860
Don't say that, it's not the time to say it.

79
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,020
What are you talking about? Please stop it.

80
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,620
You know, as a woman, I don't hate it.

81
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,960
I can imagine what you're going to do.

82
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,570
Why do I have to do this?

83
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,690
Because you're a spy.

84
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,640
I know.

85
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,750
Open it.

86
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,570
What's wrong with you, Koujyou?

87
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,540
What's wrong?

88
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,280
Stop it!

89
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,590
Let me go!

90
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
Hurry up!

91
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,430
Or do you want me to burn your nipples?

92
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:11,420
If you can bear it, then bear it.

93
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,480
No, stop it.

94
00:12:35,680 --> 00:13:00,180
Let go of me.

95
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,770
You're so strong.

96
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,950
Hey.

97
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,630
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

98
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,370
You do.

99
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,160
Who asked you to do it?

100
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,090
You're right.

101
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:59,260
Let go of me.

102
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,660
You're misunderstanding me.

103
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,600
What?

104
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,880
You're so big.

105
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,050
What's wrong with you?

106
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,130
I don't know.

107
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,320
What's wrong?

108
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,860
What's wrong?

109
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
You don't think you can take it anymore?

110
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,030
It's okay.

111
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,670
I'm enjoying it.

112
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,800
What's wrong with you?

113
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,860
It's just a crime

114
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:42,910
If I were you, I'd say you're the criminal

115
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,470
For me, you're the one who committed the crime

116
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,470
What?

117
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,980
What's wrong?

118
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,520
What?

119
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,360
It's easy to bite, isn't it?

120
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:04,760
I won't stop.

121
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,200
Come on.

122
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,080
Come on.

123
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,860
No.

124
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,390
No.

125
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,160
That's it.

126
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,020
I thought it was impossible.

127
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,920
So, I'll call a torture specialist.

128
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,720
I'll call for a specialist, so be prepared.

129
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,070
What do you think?

130
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,910
You can't even move your body.

131
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,500
Hurry up and tell me.

132
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,170
Please stop.

133
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,870
I won't tell you who you are until you tell me.

134
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,460
It's about time.

135
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,440
I have a specialist for torture.

136
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,260
I'm going to make you

137
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,440
I'll do it.

138
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,820
You said you don't know what you don't know.

140
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,600
Please.

141
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,050
Sorry to keep you waiting.

142
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,570
This is the corporate spy.

143
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,100
It's a new drug that just arrived from Mexico.

144
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,280
I'll test you with this.

145
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,580
You're so annoying.

146
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,680
Please stop.

147
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,240
What do you think? It's beautiful, isn't it?

148
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,700
Can you tell?

149
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,010
It's a bit dull.

150
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,030
Should I shoot here?

151
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,530
Stop it.

152
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,570
Should I shoot here?

153
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,100
I'm looking forward to it.

154
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,020
What kind of spy are you?

155
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,140
Do you want to be shot?

156
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,080
You said I'm not a spy.

157
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,780
I told you I don't want to do it.

158
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,800
It can't be helped.

159
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,340
Hey, it's going to feel good.

160
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,080
What is this?

161
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,640
You know what I mean.

162
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,280
What did I do?

163
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,830
I'll ask you right away.

164
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:52,670
It's getting hot.

165
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:06,480
What do you think, Kikime?

166
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,460
Are you excited?

167
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,560
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

168
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,460
Where did you get hired?

169
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:34,990
Where did you get hired?

170
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:44,110
You still don't like it?

171
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:56,670
Your pants are open!

172
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,370
You're crying, aren't you, sis?

173
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,530
You were writing something like this?

174
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,730
What's wrong?

175
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,250
Can't you feel it?

176
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,170
Hey.

177
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:24,190
What's wrong?

178
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,050
Your breathing seems to be getting worse.

179
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,350
It hurts, doesn't it?

180
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,540
You're a bad girl. Don't push me.

181
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
I didn't do anything.

182
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,700
How is it?

183
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,680
I'll grab you tight.

184
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
I can even see the wrinkles on your butt.

185
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,140
How is it?

186
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,280
Oh, your body is getting warm, isn't it?

187
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,000
It's working.

188
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,820
Right?

189
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,500
You must be tired.

190
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:33,380
What have you been looking for?

191
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,720
Taku...

192
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,260
Yes?

193
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,660
I didn't do anything.

194
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,950
See?

195
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,470
Your shoulders are getting stiff.

196
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,900
It's different, isn't it?

197
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,000
Do you hear it?

198
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Do you hear it?

199
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,020
Do you hear it deep in your body?

200
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:20,050
Do you want me to continue?

201
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,030
Do you want me to continue?

202
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,670
Do you want me to continue?

203
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,710
Do you want me to continue?

204
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,870
Do you want me to continue?

205
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:41,380
Do you want me to continue?

206
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,040
Do you want me to continue?

207
00:28:50,160 --> 00:29:06,790
Do you want me to continue?

208
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:18,180
I'll cut it for you so you don't have to go home.

209
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,040
See?

210
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,640
You don't need this.

211
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,780
What are you going to do?

212
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:36,410
What's wrong with you?

213
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,150
Did you like it?

214
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,460
You're so messy.

215
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,700
What is this?

216
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,560
It's wet.

217
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,640
You can't help it, can you?

218
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,610
What's wrong?

219
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,020
It doesn't hit.

220
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,450
It seems that there are quite a few people in Mexico.

221
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:22,080
Shall we go again?

222
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,680
Kune-chan

223
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,920
Oh, my God.

224
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,310
Oh, my God.

225
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,490
Oh, my God.

226
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,630
Oh, my God.

227
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,360
Oh, my God.

228
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:57,970
Oh, my God.

229
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,770
Oh, my God.

230
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,050
Oh, my God.

231
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,530
Oh, my God.

232
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,380
Oh, my God.

233
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,360
Oh, my God.

234
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,540
Oh, my God.

235
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,120
Oh, my God.

236
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,480
What are you going to eat?

237
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,220
To make her move.

238
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,620
Say it!

239
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,320
Say it!

240
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:56,590
Say it!

241
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:06,700
Who asked you to do this?

242
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,660
What's wrong?

243
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,660
Do you like it?

244
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,680
Do you like it?

245
00:34:37,680 --> 00:35:06,220
Hey, where are you going to continue?

246
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:49,700
Does it feel good?

247
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
Does it feel good?

248
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,640
Remember this vibration.

249
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:55,780
No

250
00:35:55,780 --> 00:37:16,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

251
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,060
I can't stand the smell of the medicine.

252
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,120
I feel like I'm going to die.

253
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,820
Does it feel good?

254
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,080
Let's go.

255
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,860
Are you going to go?

256
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:54,280
I can't believe it.

257
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,920
What's wrong with you?

258
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,170
It's been so long.

259
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:40,530
Are you okay?

260
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,970
Your baby is out.

261
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,670
Can I lick you?

262
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,190
I'm going to lick you.

263
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,610
How is it?

264
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,350
How is it?

265
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:22,470
Have you ever been trained like this?

266
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:36,510
How is it?

267
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,900
I'll give it to you.

268
00:39:47,080 --> 00:41:15,940
Are you clear now?

269
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,080
Did you get better?

270
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,820
Yes.

271
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,810
Let's take some medicine.

272
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,170
Let's have more fun.

273
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,500
Your eyes are already open.

274
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,740
Look.

275
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,980
Look at this.

276
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,410
Don't cry.

277
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,530
That's a lot of people, isn't it?

278
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:24,750
You're crying, aren't you?

279
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,410
You've been licking my ass, haven't you?

280
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,710
You've been arresting my subordinates, haven't you?

281
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,090
My important guards.

282
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,190
You've been exposed.

283
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,310
It's not over yet.

284
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

285
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

286
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:28,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

287
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

288
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

289
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:43,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

291
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

292
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

293
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

294
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

295
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:05,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

296
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:05,450
I don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,450
I can't lose to you.

298
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,590
Is this okay?

299
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,230
I'll make you confess with a new medicine.

300
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,630
It'll be even harder.

301
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,590
Or are you just looking forward to it?

302
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,560
Hey, stand up straight.

303
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,820
What's wrong? You're out of breath.

304
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,160
It's all over the place.

305
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,040
It's all over the place.

306
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:24,960
It's all over the place.

307
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:32,840
It's all over the place.

308
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,460
It's all over the place.

309
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,260
It's all over the place.

310
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,220
It's all over the place.

311
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,160
It's all over the place.

312
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,160
It's all over the place.

313
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,580
It's all over the place.

314
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,780
It's all over the place.

315
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,200
It's all over the place.

316
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,320
What's wrong with you?

317
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,440
You're already tired, aren't you?

318
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:36,010
You're always so sensitive, aren't you?

319
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,350
You can't run away, can you?

320
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,190
Hey

321
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:42,930
What's wrong?

322
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:45,870
Look, this is dangerous.

323
00:47:46,970 --> 00:48:14,180
How is it?

324
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,340
How is it?

325
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:47,390
What's wrong with your hand?

326
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:47,690
What's wrong with your hand?

327
00:48:47,950 --> 00:49:33,720
It's getting hotter than before.

328
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,320
What's wrong with your hand?

329
00:49:45,160 --> 00:50:30,760
It's getting hotter than before.

330
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:42,610
How do you like it?

331
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,190
Which one do you like better?

332
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,830
I like this one.

333
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:59,030
Does it feel good?

334
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,110
Come on, run away.

335
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,370
What's wrong?

336
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:44,920
What's wrong?

337
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:59,230
Do something with your own strength.

338
00:56:41,800 --> 00:57:05,300
You're going crazy.

339
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,920
This is torture.

340
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,240
What are you going to do?

341
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,360
Oh, you're going to hit your head.

342
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,400
What do you think?

343
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:46,990
It's the best.

344
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,650
You can't run away.

345
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:59,020
What do you think?

346
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,540
Are you happy?

347
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,240
Are you scared?

348
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,330
What do you think?

349
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:33,530
What do you think?

350
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:57,830
Did you like it?

351
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,380
Are you reacting to the sound?

352
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,740
Come on, get closer.

353
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,160
Look, it's going to hit you.

354
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,340
Look, look.

355
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,820
Look, look.

356
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:33,060
Can you still not lose?

357
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,200
You're strong.

358
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,840
Did you just say you were going to hit me?

359
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,050
What?

360
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,020
You're going, aren't you?

361
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,990
You haven't gone yet, so it's a pity.

362
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:36,950
You've gone, haven't you?

363
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:37,830
You've gone, haven't you?

364
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,300
You've gone, haven't you?

365
01:07:49,100 --> 01:08:17,090
You've gone, haven't you?

366
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:43,720
You've gone, haven't you?

367
01:08:44,240 --> 01:09:11,950
You've gone, haven't you?

368
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:14,190
You've gone, haven't you?

369
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:18,500
You've gone, haven't you?

370
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,880
You've gone, haven't you?

371
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,860
You've gone, haven't you?

372
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,000
You've gone, haven't you?

373
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,240
You've gone, haven't you?

374
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,620
Alright, look at this side.

375
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,900
Look at this side.

376
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,360
Look!

377
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:43,950
Does it feel good?

378
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,330
Does it feel good?

379
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,250
How is it?

380
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,890
How is it? How is it? How is it?

381
01:09:51,390 --> 01:10:12,760
Now, exhale.

382
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:13,880
Exhale.

383
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:34,400
I'm going to put it on your head.

384
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,410
I'm going to put it on your head.

385
01:10:50,410 --> 01:11:02,820
I'm going to put it on your head.

386
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:02,940
I'm going to put it on your head.

387
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,410
I'm going to put it on your head.

388
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:23,510
I'm going to put it on your head.

389
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:30,140
I'm going to put it on your head.

390
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,240
I'm going to put it on your head.

391
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:31,720
I'm going to put it on your head.

392
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,260
I'm going to put it on your head.

393
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,740
I'm going to put it on your head.

394
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,180
I'm going to put it on your head.

395
01:11:46,340 --> 01:12:04,260
I'm going to put it on your head.

396
01:12:04,260 --> 01:14:17,890
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

397
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:06,640
Thank you for watching!

398
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:15,960
If you admit it, how is it?

399
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:46,680
Do you feel good?

400
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,520
How do you feel?

401
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,600
I've said it many times.

402
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:44,070
I'll put it in again.

403
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:46,650
Look here directly.

404
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,550
You want to feel good, don't you?

405
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,680
What are you going to do next?

406
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:33,740
You've already fallen down to the point where you're going to fall.

407
01:18:38,470 --> 01:19:11,520
You want to have a lot of fun, don't you?

408
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:39,910
It's not going to be easy with just your fingers.

409
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:56,780
I want you to do a lot more.

410
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,530
Well, that's it.

411
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:07,110
Let's see how much you can do.

412
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:18,330
It's a pity, but you can do it.

413
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:24,620
You can do it.

414
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,210
It feels good, right?

415
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:58,220
You can do it.

416
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,220
How is it?

417
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:11,300
How is it?

418
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:18,500
It's good to be in the beginning.

419
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,200
Yes.

420
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,140
You're in.

421
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,640
This is it.

422
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:42,110
How is it?

423
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,700
How is it?

424
01:24:54,540 --> 01:25:00,410
I'm going to suck it in.

425
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,030
Look.

426
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:34,660
Can you do it?

427
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,140
It feels good.

428
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,040
It feels good, right?

429
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:49,460
You have a lot of power.

430
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,880
You have a lot of power.

431
01:25:53,880 --> 01:27:17,040
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

432
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,160
You're going to get hurt, aren't you?

433
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,060
Now, it's your turn.

434
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:45,420
Look. How is it?

435
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:53,930
What's wrong? What's with those tears?

436
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:59,420
Your tongue is crying, too.

437
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,610
You're crying, aren't you?

438
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:18,770
That's good.

439
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,500
You shouldn't have said that.

440
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,090
What is it?

441
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,740
What's wrong with you?

442
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:22,170
You got in here as a spy, didn't you?

443
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:32,210
You got in here.

444
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:39,600
You got in here, didn't you?

445
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

446
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:09,580
Get out of here!

447
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,220
How is it?

448
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,160
It's good, isn't it?

449
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,000
Hey!

450
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,860
Female spy!

451
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:44,650
If you're going to cry, stop being a spy!

452
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,200
How is it?

453
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,380
Isn't this what you want?

454
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,280
No, it's not.

455
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:32,360
You don't want it, do you?

456
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,720
Look, it's coming.

457
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:56,740
You wanted this, didn't you?

458
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,420
Is it good?

459
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,980
Oh

460
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,670
It's all wet.

461
01:37:08,550 --> 01:39:03,690
You're a good boy.

462
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:21,540
Are you okay?

463
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:56,310
I'm okay.

464
01:41:49,940 --> 01:42:40,480
It was good, wasn't it?

465
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,080
I'm okay.

466
01:44:48,330 --> 01:45:04,710
I'm okay.

467
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:07,030
I'm okay.

468
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:15,030
Oh, oh, oh.
