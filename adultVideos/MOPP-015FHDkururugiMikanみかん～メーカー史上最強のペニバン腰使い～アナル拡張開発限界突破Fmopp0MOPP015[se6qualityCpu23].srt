00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,640
見て。たくさんおもちゃがある。


00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,060
嬉しい?

3
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,130
はい。

4
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,140
今度おしりじめになっちゃう。

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,600
好きでしょう?

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,360
はい。大好き。

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,860
ここに止めたら?

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,940
はい。

9
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,810
ここに持って。

10
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,650


11
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:15,840
It's hot, isn't it?

12
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Are you feeling good?

13
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,700
Yes, I feel good.

14
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm going to rub you.

15
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,390
I'm going to massage you.

16
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,110
I can't take it anymore, so I have to drink a little more.

17
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:55,650
I can't take it anymore, so I have to drink a little more.

18
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:56,450


19
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,480
Put it in

20
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,060
Suddenly such a thick one is put into your mouth

21
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,560
Are you happy?

22
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,540
Do you feel good?

23
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes, I feel good.

24
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,260
You are having a good time, aren't you?

25
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,260


26
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,060

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,680


40
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,330
It's easy to put it in, isn't it?

41
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:22,970
Yes

42
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:31,890
Next, I will put the cold one in here

43
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,160
It's cold and hard

44
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,460
It's bumpy

45
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,330
How is it?

46
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,750
It's very cold

47
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,150
I want to go to the bathroom.

48
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,850
No, you don't have to.

49
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,590
You can go in here.

50
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,870
It's a bigger one.

51
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,310
It looks like it's going to hurt a little.

52
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,750
It feels good.

53
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,390
I put in a lot of water.

54
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,290
How is it?

55
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,530
It feels good.

56
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:43,970
Ui, ui, ui, ui, ui, ui, ui, ui, ui, ui, ui.

57
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,880
I don't know what to do.

58
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,400
Your butt is twisted.

59
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Are you okay?

60
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,440
Do you feel good?

61
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,540
Yes, I feel good.

62
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:47,220
Do you want to take a nap?

63
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,820
Yes.

64
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Nå, nå, nå, nå, nå, nå, nå, nå, nå, nå, nå.

65
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,020
Oh, oh, oh.

66
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,120
My cat is very sleepy right now.

67
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
He looks very sleepy.

68
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,680
I think this is good for him.

69
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,340
It feels good, doesn't it?

70
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,440
Yes, it does.

71
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,700
It feels good, doesn't it?

72
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,240
Yes, it does.

73
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,640
It hurts.

74
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,140
It hurts.

75
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,880
It hurts.

76
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,140
It hurts.

77
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,220
It hurts.

78
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,240
It hurts.

79
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,980
It hurts.

80
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,860
It hurts.

81
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,600
失礼したい。

82
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,320
四つん這いになって。

83
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,410
もっと大きいやつ入れてあげる。

84
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,530
はい。

85
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,310
見える?これ。

86
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,710
はい、見えます。

87
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,830
入れるかな?

88
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,870
入れてみようか。

89
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,090
はい、入れてください。

90
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,430
お尻壊れちゃうかもしれないよ。

91
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,810
I wonder if I can fit such a big one in here.

92
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,830
I'm going to put it in my ear.

93
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,540
I don't want you to fall down.

94
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,740
Don't look at me like that.

95
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,770
Do you feel good?

96
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,910
Yes, I feel good.

97
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,510
Show me your face.

98
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,430
Turn around.

99
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:31,160
Do you feel good?

100
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,020
Yes, I feel good.

101
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,580
It's getting bigger and bigger.

102
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,780
It looks like it's going to fall down.

103
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,580
It's this big.

104
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,480


105
00:18:42,620 --> 00:19:11,220


106
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:41,280


107
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,480
Do you want me to pet you?

108
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Do you want me to pet you?

109
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,290
My chimp is delicious.

110
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,110
You wanted to eat it, didn't you?

111
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,930
Eat it well.

112
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,950
I'm so happy to see you again today.

113
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,610
I'm so happy to see you again today.

114

I'm so happy to see you again today.

117
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:47,300


118
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:32,000


119
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,700
Mamma, erik du?

Erik du, no?

123
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,740
Erik du, no?

124
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000


125
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:52,860


126
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,270
It hurts?

127
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,170
I can do it again.

128
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,910
You can do it again.

129
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,250
Mr. It hurts, doesn't it?

130
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,990
Mr. You have to shake your butt.

131
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,990
Mr. It hurts.

132
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,430
When you tap your butt, the hammer will snap. It looks good, doesn't it?

133
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,750
It's getting red.

134
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,590
高くなって来た。 It's getting higher and higher.

135
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,450
全然する。 It's all done.

136
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,090
見てるでしょ。 You can see it, right?

137
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:30,970
舐められるとたまらないでしょ。 You can't stop when you're being petted.

138
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,590

気持ちいい?

165
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,820
本当に気持ちいい。

Your nose is open.

182
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:07,060
I want you to be more selfish everyday.

183
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,620

Ah, I don't feel good about that

193
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,880
Is this okay?

194
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,750
Is there a stronger stimulus?

195
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,690
I don't want you to be so strong

196
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,930
I want it

197
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:59,930
What is it?

198
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,160
Do you like my hair?

199
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,260
Yes

200
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Does it feel good?

201
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:31,980
Yes

202
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Which do you prefer, being touched or being licked?

203
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,540
It feels good

204
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:18,540
It feels good

205
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,300
Does it feel good?

206
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,620
Let's do it again

207
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:51,130
I can't do it.

208
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:15,380
I can't do it.

209
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,560
I'll massage your head.

210
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I can't do it.

211
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,490
It's hard, isn't it?

212
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,470
It's too hard.

213
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:40,750


214
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:40,060
I can't do this anymore.

215
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,740
I can't do this anymore.

216
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,600
I can't do this anymore.

217
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,560
I can't do this anymore.

218
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,920
I can't do this anymore.

219
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,120
I can't do this anymore.

220
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:59,120
I can't do this anymore.

221
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:07,590
I can't do this anymore.

222
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,070
I can't do this anymore.

223
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:37,760
What's wrong?

224
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,020
Do you like my legs?

225
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:48,300
It's easy to touch.

226
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,210
Hold it.

227
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:34,850
Do you feel good?

228
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,470
Yes, I feel good.

229
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,450
Oh, my God.

230
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,560
I feel good.

231
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,350
I feel like I'm getting something in my body.

232
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,530
You have to get a lot of lotion.

233
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,610
I'll give you a lot of lotion.

234
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:27,710
I heard it's good to raise your hips.

235
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:43,860
It feels good, doesn't it?

236
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,090
Are you okay?

237
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,890
Yes, it feels great.

238
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,210
It's not enough, is it?

239
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:24,540
You want to recover, don't you?

240
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:07,580
I feel good because it feels like I'm on a stage.

241
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,890
I feel good because it feels like I'm on a stage.

242
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,590
I feel good because it feels like I'm on a stage.

243
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:17,670
I feel good because it feels like I'm on a stage.

244
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,190
Oh, my God.

245
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,460
It's so nice to shake your hips like that.

246
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,520
Yeah, it's so nice.

247
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Kom igjen, kom igjen, kom igjen, kom igjen.

248
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,250
Må kjævla så kväll.

249
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,020
Tid på konsulatet medan du er med på det, det er kjævligt, ikkje?

250
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,200
Ja, så gode kjævla så kväll.

251
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,720
It feels good, doesn't it?

252
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,300
It feels good, doesn't it?

253
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,020
It feels good, doesn't it?

254
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,720
It feels good, doesn't it?

255
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:06,720
It feels good, doesn't it?

256
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:27,670


257
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,150
It feels good.

258
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,550
It's very intense, isn't it?

259
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,390
It's very intense.

260
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:07,990
I can't do it.

261
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:15,320
I can't do it.

262
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,220

00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,870
I want you to wake up.

275
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,600
You're so cute.

276
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,460
How about this side?

277
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,460
It's sad, it's so heavy and cold.

278
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,800
It feels good, isn't it?

279
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,780
It feels good because it's hard, doesn't it?

280
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,340
It's really hard, isn't it?

281
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:03:22,720 --> 01:04:03,390

It's hard, isn't it?

372
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,610
It's big, isn't it?

373
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,210
It's hard. It won't go in.

374
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,670
If you put it in, it'll tear apart.

375
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,270
It's going to melt, isn't it?

376
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,090
I think it's going to melt.

377
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:33,490
Can you put this in?

378
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,370
It's in.

379
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,450
Do you feel painful?

380
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,090
What is it? Do you feel painful?

381
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,830
There is a lot of blood in your body.

382
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:27,670


383
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,870
Did you do it?

384
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:42,110
You went a lot, didn't you?

385
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,050
Did you have a good time?

386
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:57,480
What should we play next time?

387
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,420
It felt really good.

388
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:45,790


389
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,590
It's hard to stand up, isn't it?

390
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,740
It's hard to stand up, isn't it?

391
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,420
It's hard to stand up, isn't it?

392
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:08,740
It's hard to stand up, isn't it?

393
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:29,660
It's really hard to stand up.

394
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:48,530


395
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:48,140


396
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,860
Take your time, take your time.

397
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,940
I can't hold it in.

398
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:53,760
No!

399
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,560
Why are you like this, Captain?

400
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

401
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,240
It's hard, isn't it?

402
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:10,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

403
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,470
Ah, it feels so good.

404
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,890
Slowly, I'll draw you.

405
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:37,790


406
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:50,340


407
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:50,580
Don't cry.

408
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,620
Don't cry.

409
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,340
Don't cry.

410
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:16,680
You can't do that.

411
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,960
Why are you doing this to yourself, Guri-chan?

412
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,940
Ah, it's so hot.

413
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,620
It's so hot.

414
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,640
It's so hot.

415
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,400
Ah!

416
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,260
Ah!

417
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,460
I have to do this for you.

418
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,660
Ah!

419
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,140
Ah, it's so hot.

420
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:40,960
Ah!

421
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:45,230
Ah!

422
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,850
It's so hot.

423
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:59,830
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

424
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:25,850


425
01:14:47,290 --> 01:15:35,700


426
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,280
It feels so good.

427
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,200
You can do it later if you want.

428
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,280
Let's do it together.

429
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:48,280


430
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:09,860
I can't do it.

431
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,520
Yes.

432
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,240
Hang in there.

433
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,440
Yes.

434
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:20,960
You can do it.

435
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:52,900


436
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,860
Aikuuu! Aikuuu!

437
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,100
Daichi-chan

438
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,200
Aaaaaa

439
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,470
Aaaaaa

440
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,540
Aaaaaa

441
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:55,340
Aaaaaa

442
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,680
Aaaaaa

443
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,540
Aaaaaa

444
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,600
Aaaaaa

445
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,260
Aaaaaa

446
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,380
Aaaaaa

447
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,920
Aaaaaa

448
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,140
Aaaaaa

449
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:02,600
Aaaaaa

450
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:02,760
Aaaaaa

451
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:08,720
Ah

452
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:16,720
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

453
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:48,350
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

454
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,600
I feel like I'm being rubbed by a fart.

455
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,540
I want to tickle you.

456
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,220
You want to tickle me?

457
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,260
It's not like you're going to be tickled by a fart.

458
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,200
You don't think you're going to be rubbed, do you?

459
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:15,200


460
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,470
I can feel the pain in the back of my head.

461
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,290
I can feel the pain in the back of my head.

462
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,090
I can feel the pain in the back of my head.

463
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,950
I can feel the pain in the back of my head.

464
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,750
I can feel the pain in the back of my head.

465
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:15,650
I can feel the pain in the back of my head.

466
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:21,750
It feels good when you tighten it like that, doesn't it?

467
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,210
I'll rub your stomach.

468
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:54,150


469
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,550
Do you want me to give you a massage?

470
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,990
You want more, don't you?

471
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:29,630
Is it hard? You like it, don't you?

472
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:36,490
How is it? This hard one?

473
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,390
How is it?

474
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:50,390


475
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:13,990
Koko? Koko ga iu?

476
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,730
Koko ga osurareru no ga iu?

477
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,550
Oshime tsuke te hanoshite kuremono yo?

478
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:06,500


479
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:30,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

480
01:24:52,760 --> 01:25:00,760


481
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:44,830


482
01:25:46,450 --> 01:26:14,690


483
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:42,490


484
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,330
Tetsu-chan?

485
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,670
Tetsu-chan is a little bit stiff.

486
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:56,170
Tetsu-chan, are you okay?

487
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:10,790
I think it feels really good.

488
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:22,870


489
01:27:50,050 --> 01:28:08,390


490
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:41,090


491
01:28:41,090 --> 01:29:11,070


492
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:30,590


493
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:33,930
I'm going to pet you now.

494
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:48,080
You miss me, don't you?

495
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:53,080
I miss you.

496
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,260
Mom, I miss you so much.

497
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,760
Wow, it's amazing.

498
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:08,900
It's okay, it's okay.

499
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,640
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

500
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,620
Do you like it, Kyo-chan?

501
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:49,780
You want me to pet you properly, right?

502
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,180
I can't do it.

503
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:58,440
I can't do it.

504
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,920
It's too big.

505
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:29,920


506
01:31:53,990 --> 01:32:08,750


507
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,880
Ah, ok.

01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,880
Ok.

Ah, stangere.

Ah, stangere.

551
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:21,230
Is it a small hand?

552
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:41,640
Oh, wow!

553
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,160
Oh, it hurts!

I love you. I love you so much.

01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:20,010
I want you to put your feet in the umbrella.

567
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,030
My feet?

568
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:25,270
