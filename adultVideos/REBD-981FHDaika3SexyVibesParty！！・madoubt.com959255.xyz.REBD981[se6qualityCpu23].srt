00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:33,090
Teksting av Nicolai Winther

4
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Teksting av Nicolai Winther

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Teksting av Nicolai Winther

8
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,310
Very much umai

00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:05,330
Umai

10
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,730
Echua, nanka shizumon seien no?

11
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,710

12
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,690
Uwari, tori ga umai

13
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,690
The way it's fried is good.

14
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,610
The saltiness is nice.

15
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,970
It's crunchy and delicious.

16
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,850
The batter is delicious.

17
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,050
What else is there?

18
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,510
It's the most stressful thing to be told what's delicious.

19
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,570
It's delicious.

20
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,590
Because it's delicious.

21
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:27,930
Grilled meat.

22
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,550
Sushi.

23
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:29,670
Fugu karaage.

24
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:30,790
Crab meat.

25
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,110
Chinese food.

26
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,250
It doesn't go well with pasta at all.

27
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:34,410
This is too delicious.

28
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:39,630
It's delicious.

29
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,890
But this video can only be seen by the person who bought the DVD.

30
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,850
I can only see it by the person who is the founder.

31
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:47,830
Yummy!

32
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,990
But the meat is a little small.

33
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,170
I like carbonara.

34
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,290
It smells good.

35
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:00,990
It's delicious!

36
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:02,610
Eh?

37
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,030
Carbonara is delicious.

38
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,590

39
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,850

46
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:40,020


47
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,410
Is this enough?

48
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,250
It's delicious. Thank you for the meal.

49
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,390
Thank you very much.

50
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,520
Haa!

51
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,040
Otsukaresama deshita.

52
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:23,760
Nagagatta.

53
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,580
Honma ni atsui shi.

54
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,320
Ano, betabetta suru shi.

55
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,220

Zen da tte shimai niya iwaremasu ya nka na.

58
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,160
Horide nugouto shita ra

59
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,780

60
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,020
Tanei yo.

61
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,420
Nga unga atte mite iru yatsu.

62
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,320
Tanei yo.

63
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,840
Nga unga dekitan kai?

64
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,420
Honnan ee wa.

65
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,220
I just wear clothes all the time and take pictures.

66
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,260
I don't look good as a sexy actress.

67
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,340
No, I look good as a sexy actress, but I don't look good as a sexy model.

68
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,920
So if it's a gravure, it's a gravure.

69
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,760
I don't want to sell my calendar with a gravure.

70
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,580
No, no, no.

71
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,840
I'm attached to it, and that's why you guys are taking pictures.

72
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,280
So I'm attached to it, and I'm going to be bald.

73
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,860
I don't like it. I'm always bald.

74
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,260
At least I have a lot of cute clothes.

75
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,660
I don't usually wear clothes like this.

76
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:25,680
Seっかくこんな衣服を用意してもらってんねんから

77
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,140
着てる状態を多めにとってほしい

78
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,200

79
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:28,460
そんなことばっか言っとるから

80
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,120
いつまで経っても

81
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,720
みんなにバカにされる職業であるやん

82
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,900
確かにそれは言えてる

83
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,600

おい、アホ、お前は何でもいいから全部買えよ、作品。わかったか?

93
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:00,190
