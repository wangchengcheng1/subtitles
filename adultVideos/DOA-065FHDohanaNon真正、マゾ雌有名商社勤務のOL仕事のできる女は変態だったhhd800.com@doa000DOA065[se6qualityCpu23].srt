1
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,490
I

2
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh, my God.

3
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,110
Oh

4
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:06,970
Oh

5
00:19:47,700 --> 00:21:08,280
Oh, my God, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die.

6
00:21:10,620 --> 00:24:19,480
It's been a long time since I've had a cat, but it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat, so it's been a long time since I've had a cat,

7
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
You look like you've turned into a pervert

8
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,200
It's all because of that

9
00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:05,090
Show me your body

10
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:47,580
Should I show you my body?

11
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:19,520
It's been a long time since I've had a baby, but I'm so happy to have a baby.

12
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm so happy to have a baby, but I'm so happy to have a baby, but I'm so happy to have a baby.

13
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:38,960
Yeah

14
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm going to say a little bit

15
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,930
I don't know.

16
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,770
You said you'd listen to whatever I say.

17
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,830
Of course.

18
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:42,100
You have to eat well.

19
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:07,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

20
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,280
It's delicious.

21
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,980
I guess we have to be...

22
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,830
I'm going to take a picture of you.

23
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:26,820
I'm going to take a picture of you.

24
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,070
I'm going to leave you here

25
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:05,050
I'm going to leave you here

26
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:44,140
What's wrong with you?

27
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,740
um

28
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:15,140
um

29
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,620
I'm full

30
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,600
There are so many

31
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,320
You will become cuter

32
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:33,900
Will I become cuter?

33
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,160
You are so cute

34
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,860
I will pull you more

35
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:58,990
I will make you cuter

36
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:11,140
I've been looking at you for a long time, but you've changed.

37
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,900
I've been looking at you for a long time, but you've changed.

38
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:40,500
I've been looking at you for a long time, but you've changed.

39
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,740
I've been looking at you for a long time, but you've changed.

40
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:09,910
I've been looking at you for a long time, but you've changed.

41
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:15,150
I've been looking at you for a long time, but you've changed.

42
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,690
I can't take my eyes off of you.

43
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,290
I can't take my eyes off of you.

44
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,290
I can't take my eyes off of you.

45
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:51,640
I can't take my eyes off of you.

46
00:40:52,080 --> 00:41:01,740
I can't take my eyes off of you.

47
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,480
I can't take my eyes off of you.

48
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:16,140
I can't take my eyes off of you.

49
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,540
Oh

50
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:41,030
So modern

51
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,370
You have a cute face.

52
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:38,900
You have a cute face.

53
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:22,810
Do you smell something?

54
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,770
What kind of smell is that?

55
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,930
It's a nice smell.

56
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,790
It's a nice face, isn't it?

57
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:37,170
What are you doing?

58
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,030
You are so thin.

59
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,210
What do you want?

60
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:44,590
You want to pee?

61
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,390
I want to pee

62
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,650
You want to pee, right?

63
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,030
I want to pee

64
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,230
I want to pee

65
00:44:58,230 --> 00:46:05,690
Try to cry more

66
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:52,070
I'm going to make you feel better, Mr. Hoshino.

67
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:56,220
Move it to the limit.

68
00:54:58,990 --> 00:57:22,750
I'm gonna do this again.

69
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:47,210
It's been a long time since I've had a baby, but it's been a long time since I've had a baby, and it's been a long time since I've had a baby, and it's been a long time since I've had a baby, and it's been a long time since I've had a baby, and it's been a long time.

70
00:59:48,870 --> 01:00:01,630
No, no, it has something to do with it.

71
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:04,250
It has something to do with it.

72
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,310
Why?

73
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:13,390
You can see the future for yourself.

74
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,090
Why?

75
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:55,690
Give it back.

76
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,370
You want me to give it back?

77
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,090
Yes.

78
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,390
Then give it back.

79
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,590
Look.

80
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:04,550
Look at this.

81
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,350
What?

82
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,120
Look at this.

83
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,700
So cute.

84
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:39,160
Do you want to talk to me?

85
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:53,840
Talk to me.

86
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:02,380
You are so cute.

87
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,910
You are so cute.

88
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:37,950
I can feel your cute face.

89
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:43,710
Do you feel good?

90
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:56,020
It feels good, doesn't it?

91
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:53,420
It's cute, isn't it?

92
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:07,130
It's difficult, isn't it?

93
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:26,060
Don't do that.

94
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:59,890
It feels good, doesn't it?

95
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,540
I'll pull you down, not just up.

96
01:05:12,600 --> 01:06:29,370
Let's go back to your room.

97
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:46,850
I'll continue.

98
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,310
I'll continue.

99
01:06:51,150 --> 01:07:01,150
Your hair has become amazing.

100
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:02,990
My hair?

101
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:08,860
Do you want me to take off your pants?

102
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,820
Then, you can continue to the other side.

103
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,760
What?

104
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,920
I'll take off your pants.

105
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,690
Will you take them off?

106
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,510
I'll take them off.

107
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,600
Do you want me to take them off?

108
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,360
Yes.

109
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,120
You have to play with them.

110
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,980
You have to live.

111
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,180
Yes.

112
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:54,030
Yes.

113
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:58,720
I'll pull them inside.

114
01:07:59,060 --> 01:07:59,860
What?

115
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:59,560
Can I take this off?

116
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,100
No, you don't want to take it off.

117
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,180
I don't want to take it off.

118
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,320
Okay, this time, I'll put it in this way.

119
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,040
What are you going to do?

120
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,160
Here?

121
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,080
Yes.

122
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:15,380
There you go.

123
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,700
You have to put your head forward.

124
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:40,520
Does it feel good? Feel it.

125
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,160
Feel it.

126
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:36,390
Keep going.

127
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:53,400
Keep going.

128
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,640
Keep going.

129
01:10:55,020 --> 01:11:32,080
Keep going.

130
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:32,960
Keep going.

131
01:11:34,660 --> 01:12:52,640
You are a good boy.

132
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,700
Did you drink?

133
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Did you drink?

134
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,480
Show me your face.

135
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,240
You were cute.

136
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,380
You were cute.

137
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:12,220
You were so cute.

138
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,190
You listened to me.

139
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:16,650
You've heard a lot of good things.

140
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,100
Let's go take a bath later.

141
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:23,660
Okay.

142
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:24,680
Come on.

143
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:34,580
Who did you belong to?

144
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,720
I belong to Matsuyama-san.

145
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,580
Matsuyama-kun, you've been raised so well.

146
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,780
That's amazing.

147
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,920
I've decided to give you to Kenzaki-san.

148
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,940
I decided to give it to you.

149
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,020
No way.

150
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,580
You still don't understand.

151
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,600
You belong to me.

152
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,420
Please take care of me.

153
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,000
Matsuyama-kun, are you sure?

154
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,220
Yes, please.

155
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,620
Look at me.

156
01:14:30,620 --> 01:15:37,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

157
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:58,460
It's the best, isn't it?

158
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:07,750
Do you like to use this place?

159
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:12,340
Please tell me.

160
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,940
It's Matsuyama-san's.

161
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:27,380
What is it about Matsuyama-san?

162
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,600
It's not mine.

163
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,030
Yes.

164
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,410
Do you want me to tell you?

165
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,340
Yes.

166
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:08,760
Okay, so if you're going to give it to me, you're going to have to break your body right here, right?

167
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,720
Okay, so the three of us are going to have fun, right?

168
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,340
Sounds good.

169
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,060
That's good, isn't it?

170
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,140
Is it good?

171
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:29,040
I'll give you a massage.

172
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,680
Look at me.

173
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:37,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

174
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,680
This is the most sensitive part of your body, isn't it?

175
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,300
Please tell me in words.

176
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,860
This is the most sensitive part of my body.

177
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,620
It's getting messier and messier.

178
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,660
Is there anything else you can feel?

179
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,540
Show me, show me.

180
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,940
Up here, too.

181
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,860
Your nipples are...

182
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:31,840
amazing.

183
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,500
I can tell you're sleeping.

184
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,740
Are you okay?

185
01:20:53,630 --> 01:21:14,470
I love the way you look when you're going crazy.

186
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,450
Can you show me that?

187
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:24,330
Feel good and go crazy.

188
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:12,520
Do you feel good?

189
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,960
I feel good.

190
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,560
You feel good, don't you?

191
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,020
You've been raised well.

192
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,200
I feel like I want to bite you.

193
01:23:25,420 --> 01:24:08,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

194
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,460
You're a good boy, aren't you?

195
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,820
Show me what you've got.

196
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:46,110
You're a good talker.

197
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:57,830
Oh, you can see it well, you can see it well.

198
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:01,290
You can't let go of my hand.

199
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:15,750
Shimari is also good.

200
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,090
Shimari is good.

201
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,190
Thank you very much.

202
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,940
Hey, do it for me.

203
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,960
Please use my manko freely.

204
01:25:50,640 --> 01:26:09,910
Hey, do it properly one more time.

205
01:26:21,270 --> 01:27:19,190
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

206
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:39,950
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

207
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,080
Let me show you where you're going to go.

208
01:27:49,060 --> 01:28:00,820
I'll pick you up there again.

209
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:14,080
I'll give you a lot of money.

210
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,840
It's a mess over there.

211
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,480
You look good.

212
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,020
You look good.

213
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,720
Look this way.

214
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:03,020
Amazing.

215
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:59,070
You look like a mangrove.

216
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,120
I'm going to take care of you.

217
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:22,040
I'm going to take care of you.

218
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:28,300
I'm going to take care of you.

219
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,160
I'm going to take care of you.

220
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:34,920
I'm going to take care of you.

221
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,920
I'm going to take care of you.

222
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,920
I'm going to take care of you.

223
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,020
I'm going to take care of you.

224
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,440
I'm going to take care of you.

225
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,560
I'm going to take care of you.

226
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:43,520
I'm going to take care of you.

227
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,860
I'm going to take care of you.

228
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:45,440
I'm going to take care of you

229
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,080
Oh, this feels good.

230
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,060
You're good, aren't you?

231
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,400
You've been taught a lot, haven't you?

232
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:14,620
It's good, isn't it?

233
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,500
It's the best.

234
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,920
Let's do it while looking at my face.

235
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:30,720
You don't like it?

236
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:38,190
This hand is open.

237
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:51,090
There are two of them, so you have to do them alternately.

238
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,470
Look, you have to move your hands.

239
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,180
That's good.

240
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:18,520
Um

241
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:41,560
More talk money I know

242
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,800
So much my car

243
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:54,480
So they're so they're so easy to get on

244
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:31,340
Show me your face when you get in the house.

245
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:47,240
Show me your face when you get in the house.

246
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,300
Show me your face.

247
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:12,310
Why are you putting it in yourself?

248
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:14,810
Did it grow?

249
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:21,370
Show me your face.

250
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:23,770
Show me your face.

251
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:27,150
Oh

252
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,870
Chinko, Iりました yeah

253
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,830
Motoki

254
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:40,410
Koguro

255
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,380
Scala

256
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:23,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

257
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:59,750
You have to be careful not to hurt her.

258
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,510
Now, come into my arms.

259
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:10,240
Look at her face and shake her head.

260
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:57,760
Let's do it.

261
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:57,840
Let's do it.

262
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,120
Good boy.

263
01:37:29,440 --> 01:38:03,350
That's the best.

264
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:16,450
It feels good, doesn't it?

265
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:48,150
Come on, let's see if you can do it.

266
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,340
There you go.

267
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:50,770
Do you want to see?

268
01:39:51,810 --> 01:40:21,140
Good girl.

269
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:28,560
Do you want more, Chinko?

270
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,360
Do you want more?

271
01:40:33,360 --> 01:45:14,500
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

272
01:45:14,500 --> 01:46:39,340
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

273
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:40,840
You did a good job.

274
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:51,640
Can you see the exhaust?

275
01:47:27,100 --> 01:48:03,600
That's right.

276
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:33,870
You're a good boy.

277
01:48:54,170 --> 01:49:01,110
Oh

278
01:51:02,800 --> 01:52:02,120
Oh my god, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore.

279
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:02,520
Do you want some?

280
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,940
I want it.

281
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,300
Where do you want it?

282
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:07,560
I want it.

283
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,220
I want it.

284
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,340
I want it.

285
01:53:11,620 --> 01:54:12,000
I love you so much.

286
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:26,720
Hey, open your mouth.

287
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:43,020
You don't want to feel pain, do you?

288
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:50,670
Do you still want to be tortured?

289
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:50,910
Do you want to eat it?

290
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,730
Look at this.

291
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:01,100
You're going to be released.

292
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:04,020
I have no choice but to talk to you.

293
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:45,540
Do it more firmly.

294
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:46,840
Hey.

295
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:47,020
Hey

296
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:50,160
I told you to be quiet

297
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:50,700
Huh?

298
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,640
You are too big

299
01:55:58,860 --> 01:55:59,980
I'm going to save you

300
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:01,880
Come here

301
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:57,980
Come here

302
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:26,580
You are too big

303
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:29,560
Come here

304
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:44,490
Come here

305
01:57:56,730 --> 01:58:00,600
Come here.

306
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:05,060
Come here.

307
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:06,160
What are you doing?

308
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:34,080
I can't breathe, so I'm going to do this.

309
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:35,600
Hey!

310
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:37,800
Hey!

311
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:46,450
Look at me, I'm about to cry.

312
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:49,070
Huh?

313
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:47,110
It's not easy at all, isn't it?

314
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:48,850
Hey!

315
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:51,190
Huh?

316
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:53,030
Hey!

317
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:01,070
Do you like Kinpo?

318
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:21,560
Come here!

319
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:46,620
You're happy, aren't you?

320
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,080
Hey!

321
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:51,260
Huh?

322
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:07,940
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

323
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:17,100
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

324
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:47,580
