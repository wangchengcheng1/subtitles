1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,640
Why can't you do such a thing?


00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,760
You're a pain in the neck.

3
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,520
Get out of here.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,320
Hey, hurry up.

5
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,380
It's been a while.

6
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,580
I heard you succeeded, but did you really become a top?

7
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,820
You've always known that I'm special.

8
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
What did you come here for?

9
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,460
I don't want you to fight with Jodan anymore.

10
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,600
Why do I have to do such a thing?

11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,880
For me.

12
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,600
For me?

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,620
For me?

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,580
I don't have the guts to quit for you.

15
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,960
It started again.

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,380
Do you even know what you're saying?

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
I loved you more than anyone else.

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,100
We were together all the time.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,460
But you left me and went to Jordan.

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,140
I can't believe you're saying that now.

21
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,140
Don't say that.

22
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,760
I came here today because I want to stop fighting with each other.

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,540
I want to stop being a monster.

24
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,940
We broke up because you became a monster who lost yourself.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm not a monster.

26
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,760
Emily, I'm not. I didn't mean it.

27
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,400
Kneel down.

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,310
I didn't mean to transform. Please.

29
00:04:36,680 --> 00:05:20,980


30
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,860
But I can't stand you anymore.

31
00:05:39,900 --> 00:06:17,880
I'll let you go.

32
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:28,010
Oh, my God.

33
00:07:46,040 --> 00:08:16,440


34
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,980
I can't take it anymore.

35
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,500
I can't take it anymore.

36
00:08:30,500 --> 00:10:22,560


37
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,180
I love you so much, Emily.

38
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:48,390
I sent my sister, but Jordan is going to die soon.

39
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,570
I took Jordan from you.

40
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,290
This is all mine.

41
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:33,010
Oh, my God.

42
00:11:37,230 --> 00:12:04,970


43
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,430
to get out of here.
